DESCRIPTION:<p>Domestic Harmony is a blend of voices\, of styles and genres
 . We play tunes from the American Songbook: pop tunes from the 50s\, 60s a
 nd 70s\, some more current still\, and a sprinkling of tunes from other ti
 mes. Most you know\, and most you love. We write about a third of our musi
 c. We find that people quickly love those songs\, too\, and ask for them b
 y name. You’ll hear some pop\, some soft rock\, some R & B\, some jazz\, s
 ome folk.</p>\n<p>We relish the dance of voices\, the twining and twinning
  of strings\, the space between the notes\, the song beyond the notes sung
  and played. Our songs are our own\, whether written by us or borrowed fro
 m another time\, another artist or band. You might hear the Beatles or Smo
 key Robinson\, Dylan or Dusty Springfield\, Leonard Cohen or Bonnie Raitt\
 , The Everly Brothers or Eva Cassidy. Whatever it is\, vocal harmony is th
 e thing\, with a smile and bounce to its step.</p>
