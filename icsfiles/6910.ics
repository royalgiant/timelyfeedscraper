 ailwagger’s Trot is the Humane League’s biggest fundraiser event of the ye
 ar! People from all over secure pledges from their family\, friends\, neig
 hbors\, their friend’s friends\, their family’s neighbors… (you get the id
 ea!) and then they come together to trot for our community’s homeless anim
 als. Most trotters come with their dogs\, but some trot with their cats in
  strollers\, their pet rat in a cozy carrier\, their ferret riding on thei
 r shoulder or their pet goat on a leash! At the conclusion of the walk\, t
 here will be family-friendly fun\, entertainment\, food vendors\, arts & c
 rafts and more!</p>\n<p style='padding-left: 30px\;'>>> <a href='http://hu
