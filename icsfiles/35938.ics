 La Santa Cecilia spreads joy every time its members plug in to do a show.”
  </strong>– </em>NPR</p>\n<p><em><strong>“An eclectic mixture of original 
 material\, traditional songs and covers sung in Spanish and English\, mean
 t to get listeners dancing and thinking at the same time\, embracing a mod
 ern sensibility while also evoking the old.” </strong>– </em>New York Time
 s</p>\n<p>GRAMMY Award-winning Latin rock band <strong>La Santa Cecilia</s
 trong> exemplifies the modern-day creative hybrid of Latin culture\, rock\
 , and world music. The group draws inspiration from all over the world\, u
 tilizing Pan-American rhythms like cumbia\, bossa nova\, rumba\, bolero\, 
 tango\, jazz\, rock\, and klezmer music. Its unique sound and the experien
 ce of its colorful\, passionate performances leaves fans and new listeners
  mesmerized.</p>\n</p>\n<p>La Santa Cecilia consists of accordionist and r
 equintero <strong>Jose “Pepe” Carlos</strong>\, bassist <strong>Alex Benda
 na</strong>\, percussionist <strong>Miguel Ramirez</strong>\, and lead voc
 alist <strong>La Marisoul</strong>\, whose captivating voice sings about l
 ove\, loss and heartbreak. Their influences range from <strong>Miles Davis
 </strong> to <strong>The Beatles</strong>\,<strong> Led Zeppelin</strong> 
 to <strong>Janis Joplin</strong> and <strong>Mercedes Sosa</strong> to <st
 rong>Ramon Ayala</strong>. Their common love of music and openness to all 
 genres led them to the concept of La Santa Cecilia in 2007 – named after t
 he patron saint of musicians.</p>\n</p>\n<p>In 2013\, the band released th
 eir major label debut <em>Treinta Dias</em> (30 Days)\, which featured a c
 aptivating collaboration with fan <strong>Elvis Costello</strong> on “Losi
 ng Game.” Now\, just after their GRAMMY win for Best Latin Rock\, Urban or
  Alternative Album\, the band presents their new album <em>Someday New</em
 >. The album features seven new tracks\, which include a heartfelt Spangli
 sh rendition of The Beatles iconic “Strawberry Fields Forever”\, plus the 
 unforgettable new Mexican classic “Como Dios Manda”\; as well as a fresh n
 ew radio-edit of their single “Monedita” and the full version of their mov
 ing\, and militant “ICE – El Hielo.”</p>\n<p><strong><a href='http://lasan

  troubadour with some connections. Tommy Emmanuel plays on several tracks 
 and Lindsey Buckingham sings harmony on Time-Sweetened Lies. Creative\, ro
 otsy\, and wonderful. If you like it served 100 proof\, step right up.” <
 /em></strong>– Robert K. Oermann\, Music Row News\, Nashville</p>\n<p><em>
 <strong>“When I first looked into the Trailer Park Troubadours\, I was pre
 pared for them to be funny. What I wasn’t prepared for was these guys are 
 flat-out GREAT. Their humor is obvious. When they sing songs like “My Baby
  Whistles When She Walks” (it’s not what you think)\, it’s a scream. But t
 hen\, a few songs in\, you hear something as poignant and rich as “Primer 
 Grey Impala\,” you kinda sit up and take notice. These guys can really\, R
 EALLY\, play and sing.”</strong></em><br />\n– Take Country Back\, www.ta
 kecountryback.com</p>\n<p>Singer\, songwriter\, humorist and small town ph
 ilosopher<strong> Antsy McClain</strong> writes what he knows: The good li
 fe.</p>\n</p>\n<p>Staging his live shows from a small\, fictitious trailer
  park called Pine View Heights (patterned after his own childhood surround
 ings and experiences)\, McClain is free from an over-abundance of material
  things and appreciates time with family and friends.</p>\n<p>Sharing his 
 mantra of “Enjoy The Ride\,” McClain has won friendship and collaboration 
 with some of the most talented musicians in the world. With such a wide ci
 rcle of mentors like <strong>Waylon Jennings</strong>\, <strong>Tommy Smot
 hers</strong>\, guitar legend <strong>Tommy Emmanuel</strong> and cowboy p
 oet <strong>Baxter Black</strong>\, it’s no wonder McClain marches to the 
 beat of a different drum. And his influences don’t stop there. His live sh
 ows touch upon Country\, Rockabilly\, Jazz\, Swing\, and a number of Pop c
 ulture references.</p>\n<p>McClain’s poetry\, heart-felt ballads and humor
 ous tales have garnered praise from such artists as <strong>Guy Clark</str
 ong>\, <strong>Willie Nelson</strong>\, <strong>Lindsay Buckingham</strong
 >\, and <strong>David Wilcox</strong>\, to name a few.</p>\n<p>After a Nas
 hville record deal proved unfruitful in 1999\, McClain took the reins hims
 elf and blazed one of the industries first fiercely independent campaigns\
 , producing some of Americana’s most innovative projects\, and cleverly re
 lying on fan involvement (They call themselves Flamingoheads) to finance e
 ach album\, and help promote live shows and events.</p>\n</p>\n<p>Before m
 usic found him\, Antsy was an award-winning illustrator and designer for b
 ook and magazine publishers. As the DIY movement took hold\, McClain was o
 ne of the first artists of note to not only record\, mix and produce his o
 wn albums\, but to serve as art director and designer for everything invol
 ving his music career\; from CD package design to website design to mercha
 ndise. The band’s t-shirts are looked at as one-of-a-kind boutique item or
 iginals\, often signed and numbered when sold.</p>\n<p>When accused of bei
 ng a control freak\, McClain flashes a guilty look\, but dissuades the dig
  by saying\, “I’ve always just tried to save myself money. I was a self em
 ployed guy with five kids. We had an agreement that my wife was to be home
  while they were young\, and it worked out great. But I didn’t have a thou
 sand dollars to pay somebody for a logo. If I was going to have one\, I’d 
 have to do it.”</p>\n<p>Calling himself “a life enthusiast\,” Antsy McClai
 n is eager to see what’s around every corner\, and watches the horizon int
 ently for each new change that takes place.</p>\n</p>\n<p>“My life is my a
 rt\,” explains Antsy\, “I am painting my life one day at a time\, one brus
 h stroke at a time. As I spend time with my wife and children\, or as I go
  on the road toward new places to make new friends\, as I write a new song
 \, as I draw or paint something for people to look at and enjoy… This is m
 y life\, and I’m grateful to have the opportunity to share it with music\,
  with words and with pictures.”</p>\n<p>McClain looks out the window as a 
 car whirs past\, “I am enjoying the ride.”</p>\n<p><strong><a href='http:/

 e executive producer\, visionary\, director and scribe for the sacred soun
 d theater movement seven7sisters \, that has involved 100’s of woman since
  2001. Starsinger was born and raised in canada and moved to the U.S. in 2
 008. She is a universal minister\, Iyanifa\, celestial priestess\, Geomanc
 er and transformational healer\, specializing in sacred theater\, planetar
 y light work and unique healing abilities. Musically Starsinger has been t
 rained as a crystal singer and has mastered working with crystal singing b
 owls.<br />\nAt the age of 20 Starsinger was initiated as a high priestess
  of the goddess facilitated by Ariel Spilsbury\, the author of the Mayan O
 racle and the 13 moon oracle\, she also received the name Starsinger from 
 this initiation. She was also initiated into a ancient Druid mystery schoo
 l at around the same time. These initiations sent her on a deep journey to
  the discovery of self and of the divine. Through this she started to stud
 y everything she could from the gnostic teachings\, to buddhism\, to nativ
 e american wisdom\, to east indian\, and the list goes on. She then met Am
 ma Chi\, she says the most amazing part about being around Amma\, was watc
 hing her create miracles for people through the simple power of love. She 
 was adopted by two different hawaiian families and given permission as Hin
 ai\, to carry the Huna lineage\, she was given the name OhuaNapua\, in a h
 awaiian naming ceremony\, which means “gatherer of the descendants”. Most 
 recently Starsinger was initiated into the West African tradition of IFA a
 nd as a priestess of the ancient African goddess Oshun. One common element
  Starsinger has found in all her travels into different religious houses\,
  has been the power of sound. Music\, song and chant is an integral aspect
  of every culture\, there is not one culture that does not understand this
  language\, it is the true voice of the heart\, the voice that unifies.</p

 \n<p>Chishti has performed at a number of Sufi shrines and festivals since
  2001\, the most famous ones being the tombs of Data Ganj Baksh in Lahore\
 , Baba Ganj-i-Shakar in Pak Pattan\, Baba Bulleh Shah in Kasur and Baba La

  women across Pakistan by performing at various shrines where women rarely
  take on a prominent role.</p>\n<p>Chishti’s journey towards Sufism and de
 voting her life to classical music began when she was given a Nusrat Fateh
  Ali Khan music cassette eleven years ago. “It was then that classical mus
 ic just immediately touched my soul and my quest began\,” she said. While 
 travelling back and forth between America\, India and Pakistan\, her journ

 d and toured with Khan during his heyday. He practices a unique style of t
 abla playing known to be over 1\,000 years old and drafted by the legendar
 y poet Amir Khusro. The style is a combination of ‘jori’ which is used as 
 the treble and ‘dhamma’ which creates a deeper sound. “I came to Dildar wi
 th the hope and will to learn” she said “Today I not only perform to sprea
 d the message of Sufis in the West but I also teach the rare music form” s

 ct to a level of detail that befits a rock band famous for its fanatical f
 ollowing.” </strong></em>– Associated Press</p>\n<p><em><strong>“The hotte
 st Grateful Dead tribute act. A cover band for people who don’t like cover
  bands.” </strong></em>– The Washington Post</p>\n<p>Dark Star Orchestras 
 shows are built off the catalog of the Grateful Dead. On any given night t
 he band will perform a show based on a set list from the Grateful Dead’s 3
 0 years of extensive touring or use the catalog of original songs and ofte
 n played covers to create a unique set list for the show. This allows musi
 c fans both young and old to share in the experience. Dark Star Orchestra 
 presents its critically acclaimed live show at esteemed venues from coast 
 to coast and internationally. Grateful Dead classics are performed in the 
 same way that an orchestra interprets music of classical composers. The co
 mposer spirit is derived and channeled as the players capture the exciteme
 nt and innovation of the original performances and compositions.</p>\n</p>
 \n<p>Touring nationwide for over 17 years to the tune of nearly 2400 shows
  since forming\, the band’s determined commitment to “raising the Dead” ha
 s drawn national media attention.</p>\n<p>Critics aren’t the only ones sin
 ging Dark Star Orchestra’s praises. Five original members of the Grateful 
 Dead have played alongside DSO and have had this to say: “Playing with Dar
 k Star Orchestra is something that feels just exactly like it felt when I 
 was playing with the Grateful Dead.” Donna Jean Godchaux-McKay\, Grateful 
 Dead vocalist\, frequent DSO guest.</p>\n</p>\n<p>Precision is king with D
 SO\; the band adapts their stage positioning\, vocal arrangements\, specif
 ic musical equipment and instruments to fit the era of the show they are p
 erforming. Following each performance the band announces the date and venu
 e of the original performance. Dark Star Orchestra could dip into any inca
 rnation of the dead at any of their shows\, allowing fans to experience s
 hows that happened long before they were born.</p>\n</p>\n<p><strong><a hr

 e executive producer\, visionary\, director and scribe for the sacred soun
 d theater movement seven7sisters \, that has involved 100’s of woman since
  2001. Starsinger was born and raised in canada and moved to the U.S. in 2
 008. She is a universal minister\, Iyanifa\, celestial priestess\, Geomanc
 er and transformational healer\, specializing in sacred theater\, planetar
 y light work and unique healing abilities. Musically Starsinger has been t
 rained as a crystal singer and has mastered working with crystal singing b
 owls.<br />\nAt the age of 20 Starsinger was initiated as a high priestess
  of the goddess facilitated by Ariel Spilsbury\, the author of the Mayan O
 racle and the 13 moon oracle\, she also received the name Starsinger from 
 this initiation. She was also initiated into a ancient Druid mystery schoo
 l at around the same time. These initiations sent her on a deep journey to
  the discovery of self and of the divine. Through this she started to stud
 y everything she could from the gnostic teachings\, to buddhism\, to nativ
 e american wisdom\, to east indian\, and the list goes on. She then met Am
 ma Chi\, she says the most amazing part about being around Amma\, was watc
 hing her create miracles for people through the simple power of love. She 
 was adopted by two different hawaiian families and given permission as Hin
 ai\, to carry the Huna lineage\, she was given the name OhuaNapua\, in a h
 awaiian naming ceremony\, which means “gatherer of the descendants”. Most 
 recently Starsinger was initiated into the West African tradition of IFA a
 nd as a priestess of the ancient African goddess Oshun. One common element
  Starsinger has found in all her travels into different religious houses\,
  has been the power of sound. Music\, song and chant is an integral aspect
  of every culture\, there is not one culture that does not understand this
  language\, it is the true voice of the heart\, the voice that unifies.</p

 devoted foreigners who have dedicated their lives to spread the message of
  Sufis in the West since 2001. They have performed at hundreds of festival
 s and concerts worldwide where they share their passion for qawwalis.</p>
 \n<p>Chishti has performed at a number of Sufi shrines and festivals since
  2001\, the most famous ones being the tombs of Data Ganj Baksh in Lahore\
 , Baba Ganj-i-Shakar in Pak Pattan\, Baba Bulleh Shah in Kasur and Baba La
 suri Shah in Faisalabad. In India\, she has performed at the tombs of Khwa
 ja Nizamuddin Aulia\, Hazrat Amir Khusrau\, Pir Inayat Khan and Khwaja Moi
 nuddin Chishti.</p>\n<p>With her devotion\, she has changed boundaries for
  women across Pakistan by performing at various shrines where women rarely
  take on a prominent role.</p>\n<p>Chishti’s journey towards Sufism and de
 voting her life to classical music began when she was given a Nusrat Fateh
  Ali Khan music cassette eleven years ago. “It was then that classical mus
 ic just immediately touched my soul and my quest began\,” she said. While 
 travelling back and forth between America\, India and Pakistan\, her journ
 ey led her to the legendary Dildar Hussain Khan\, a tabla master who worke
 d and toured with Khan during his heyday. He practices a unique style of t
 abla playing known to be over 1\,000 years old and drafted by the legendar
 y poet Amir Khusro. The style is a combination of ‘jori’ which is used as 
 the treble and ‘dhamma’ which creates a deeper sound. “I came to Dildar wi
 th the hope and will to learn” she said “Today I not only perform to sprea
 d the message of Sufis in the West but I also teach the rare music form” s
 he added.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href='http://www.stellamara.com/' target='_bl

  is not found again.” This ancient idiom is at the heart of brothers Dave 
 Alvin and Phil Alvin’s long\, tumultuous relationship. However\, in Dave’s
  own words\, “Sometimes Fate\, or God or the Universe\, gives you a rare c
 hance to prove an old saying is wrong.” The brothers’ new album\, appropri
 ately titled ‘Lost Time’\,does just that.</p>\n<p>Over ‘Lost Time’s’ twelv
 e tracks\, Dave and Phil pay homage to a number of artists and songs that 
 had an early\, formative influence\, in Dave’s words “the masters of the B
 lues\, the most transcendental form of American music.” Everyone from Lead
  Belly to James Brown is represented\, but the figure who looms largest on
  the album\, and in the brothers’ own musical journey\, is Big Joe Turner.
  The Alvins met Big Joe as teenagers\, and he would mentor them for the re
 mainder of his life. They remain his humble students\, and cut four Turner
 songs for ‘Lost Time.’</p>\n<p>If their GRAMMY-nominated 2014 album ‘Commo
 n Ground’ was the sound of a partnership rekindled\, ‘Lost Time’ is a four
 -alarm fire. Dave’s guitar work slithers and stings as never before\, and 
 Phil’s feral howl cuts to the core.Dave and Phil both sing and play guitar
  throughout ‘Lost Time\,’ and are joined by a crack band including Lisa Pa
 nkratz (drums)\, Brad Fordham (bass)\, and Chris Miller (guitar).</p>\n<p>
 The Alvin brothers founded seminal early LA punk roots band The Blasters i
 n 1979\, and after Dave left the group in 1986\, they did not record an al
 bum together again until ‘Common Ground.’ In addition to its Grammy nomina
 tion\, that record earned wide critical acclaim\, and features with NPR’s 
 Fresh Air\, The LA Times\, Wall Street Journal and more.</p>\n<p>Listen to

 <p> </p>\n<p><em><strong>“Producer Joe Henry smartly keeps both voices cle
 an and sharp in lean\, supple arrangements that accommodate the torch and 
 twang of each number — and the wide range of emotions expressed here\, fro
 m nostalgia and regret to the in-the-moment joy that can endure\, and thri

  Harris</strong> and <strong>Rodney Crowell</strong>’s second duet album—<
 strong><em>The Traveling Kind</em></strong>\, produced by <strong>Joe Henr
 y</strong>—is out May\, 12\, 2015 on<strong>Nonesuch Records</strong>. In

 d by <strong>Elvis Costello</strong>. The duo is currently wrapping up a s
 eries of performances in the US before beginning their <em>The Traveling K
 ind </em>tour this fall.</p>\n<p><em>The Traveling Kind</em> was selected 
 as a <em>First Listen</em> by NPR Music\, which said\, “As they swap lines
  and leads between his reedy resilience and her gossamer vibrato\, Harris 
 and Crowell don’t just share the spotlight. They also share the weight of 
 legacy\, influence and lifelong artistic investment\, bearing down when th
 e emotional heft of a song calls for it\, loosening up and growing playful
  when it doesn’t\, and altogether lightening the load for each other. This
  is what it sounds like when true equals\, both deep into their journeys\,
  draw out the best in each other.” And <em><a href='http://www.rollingston
 e.com/music/premieres/hear-emmylou-harris-and-rodney-crowell-toast-the-uns

 <p>At the host’s request\, Harris and Crowell recently made a special appe
 arance on one of the final episodes of the <strong><em>Late Show with Davi
 d Letterman</em></strong>\, performing “Will the Circle Be Unbroken” along
 side Steve Martin\, Amos Lee and Mark O’Conner.</p>\n</p>\n<p><em>The Trav

 as two awards at the 2013 Americana Music Association Honors & Awards Show

  at #4 on the <em>Billboard</em>’s Top Country Albums chart.</p>\n<p>Produ

  Costello\, Aimee Mann)\, <em>The Traveling Kind </em>comprises 11 duet tr
 acks\, including six new songs written by Harris and Crowell with co-writi

 ured are new renditions of previous Crowell songs including “No Memories H
 anging Around” as well as new interpretations of Lucinda Williams’ “I Just
  Wanted to See You So Bad” and Amy Allison’s “Her Hair Was Red.” The full 
 track listing is below.</p>\n<p>Of the project\, Harris comments\, “In the
  words of Willie Nelson\, ‘The life I love is making music with my friends
 \,’ and there’s no better friend for me to make music with than Rodney. I 
 can’t wait to get out there on the road with him and play the songs from t
 his new record.”</p>\n<p>Crowell adds\, “Emmy and I co-wrote six of the 11
  songs on <em>The Traveling Kind</em>\, which was recorded in a six-day sp
 an with our Glory Band\, Steuart Smith and Billy Payne. Joe Henry was at t
 he helm as producer and Justin Neibank did the recording. The experience w
 as pretty much akin to falling off a log.”</p>\n<p>A 13-time Grammy winner

 p>\n<div dir='ltr'><strong>Tickets on sale </strong><br />\n<strong>Saturd
 ay\, August 8</strong></div>\n<p>If there were a map of <strong>Sean Hayes
 ’</strong> 20-plus year career\, it would be circuitous. A tangled <span>c
 riss-crossing</span> of <span>backroads</span> and blue highways denoting 
 place\, influence\, and trajectory. You can hear it in the deep-roots sync
 opation\, in the dusty folk-stomp and in the biorhythmic pulse that ebbs a
 nd thumps throughout his soul-tinged songs.</p>\n<p>For Hayes\, it’s never
  been about the destination. It’s always been about the journey: The words
  on paper\, fingers on strings\, impromptu dance parties\, darkened clubs\
 , late night mysteries\, firing synapses\, human connection\, deeper meani
 ng and the kind of beats that really make a body move. “I got moves the ki
 ds ain’t seen\,” he sings on “Magic Slim vs. Dynamite.” The smoke-and-spar
 klers dance party video for the song aptly captures the serious fun of his
  music.</p>\n</p>\n<p>Born in New York and raised in North Carolina\, Haye
 s headed for California two decades ago. It was in San Francisco that his 
 career blossomed. But Hayes credits the Carolinas towns like Asheville and
  Charleston — places where he first wrote and performed tunes such as “Mar
 y <span>Magdelene”</span> — with imprinting him as an artist.</p>\n<p>Haye
 s forges songs that\, even to the uninitiated\, sound like hits. He’s been
  compared to <strong>Bill Withers</strong> for his rhythmic sense and his 
 soulfulness. His “Powerful Stuff\,” got a lot of mileage in a Subaru comme
 rcial. “Dream Machine” was re-mixed by <strong>DJ Mark Farina</strong>\, “
 A Thousand Tiny Pieces” was covered by folk group<strong> The Be Good <spa
 n>Tanyas</span></strong>\, “Fucked Me Right Up” landed on the soundtrack t
 o HBO’s “Bored to Death.” He has <span>dueted</span> with <strong>Aimee Ma
 nn</strong>\, toured with the likes of <strong><span>Ani</span> <span>DiFr
 anco</span></strong> and the <strong>Cold War Kids</strong>\, and his brea
 thlessly sexy slow dance\, “When We Fall In\,” inspired pop star <strong>J
 ustin Timberlake</strong> to blog rhapsodic.</p>\n</p>\n<p>Listening to hi
 s songs on recording is one thing\, live is another experience altogether.
  Hayes is at once dynamic and laid back on stage. His ability to be authen
 tic in front of an audience comes\, he says\, “from having just enough of 
 a theater background to realize that being yourself on stage is more inter
 esting than any stereotyped character.” He adds\, “I’ve always been intere
 sted in revealing and stripping down and being open.”</p>\n</p>\n<p>The mu
 sician has covered a lot of ground in his tenure\, but now\, seven albums 
 in\, he shows no sign of slowing. “Music has changed a lot\,” he says of h
 is time in the profession. “You used to have to spend time with a record. 
 You had to take chances and buy records. They were real objects that took 
 up space in your room. Now we have access to enough music\, on our phones\
 , to fill libraries.” So how to stand out among a sea of musical artists? 
 Hayes continues to hone his intoxicating blend of ease\, effortless cool a
 nd magnetism. There’s a definite continuity over the span of his back cata
 log\, which dates to his 1999 debut\, <em>A Thousand Tiny Pieces</em>. The
 re’s also a distilling of intention and refining of style. He revisits sub
 ject matter — sex\, emotion\, universal life experience — from album to al
 bum. “Themes will recycle some\,” he says\, but Hayes’ approach is more of
  a spiraling in and deepening of understanding than a simple return.</p>\n

 ed. What starts as an off the cuff joke during a handball competition\, so
 on turns into a set of circumstances whereby Jack is no longer safe in the
  playground. But with the use of self-expression through photography\, Jac
 k begins to make sense of his world\; of his relationships with others\, a
 nd most importantly\, with himself.</p>\n<p>This one man show explores the
  often overlooked insidious taunting and teasing that bullies are so adept
  at inflicting on their victims and the roles that family and schools can 
 play in responding. Jack takes us on a touching and sometimes comical jour
 ney as he moves from victim to victor.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<d

  potential to permanently affect the musical landscape and keep us enterta
 ined for years to come.”</strong></em> – Billboard.</p>\n<p>Remember that 
 mix tape your friend made you way back when – the one that’s etched in you
 r soul? <strong>Martin Sexton’s</strong> new album <em>Mixtape of the Open
  Road</em> is that musical cross-country trip\, blazing through all territ
 ories of style\, as you cruise through time and place. This record is a ch
 arm bracelet of twelve gems all strung together with the golden thread of 
 what Rolling Stone calls his “soul marinated voice.”</p>\n</p>\n<p>Sexton\
 , an upstate New Yorker\, left home with seventy-five bucks and a Stratoca
 ster to chase his musical dreams singing in the streets of Harvard Square 
 in Cambridge\, Massachusetts\, gradually and independently working his way
  to the premier venues of North America inspiring fans and musicians along
  the way. “Sexton is ripe with raw\, expansive talent. His voice comes in 
 a hundred impossible shades. His songs are sweet and spirited ans soulful.
  His repetoire is like a cross-country tour of the American musical vernac
 ular.” – Boston Globe. The activity and touring behind his records laid th
 e foundation for the career he enjoys today headlining everywhere from The
  Filmore to Carnegie Hall.</p>\n<p>From the nineties to-date\, Sexton rele
 ased<em> In The Journey</em> (’92)\, <em>Black Sheep</em> (’96)\,<em> The 
 American</em> (’98)\, <em>Wonder Bar</em> (2000)\, <em>Live Wide Open</em>
  (’02)\, <em>Camp Holiday</em> (’05)\, <em>Seeds</em> (’07)\, <em>Sugarcoa
 ting</em> (’10)\, <em>Fall Like Rain</em> (’12)\, and now\, <em>Mixtape</e
 m> (’15)</p>\n<p>Since launching his own label\, KTR\, the fiercely indepe
 ndent Sexton has infiltrated many musical worlds\, performing at concerts\
 , ranging from pop (collaborating with<strong> John Mayer</strong>) to the
  Jam scene to classic rock (collaborating with<strong> Peter Frampton</str
 ong>)\; from the Newport Folk Fest to Bonnaroo to New Orleans Jazz Fest to
  now shows around the world.</p>\n<p>Regardless of his reputation as a mus
 ician’s musician\, Sexton can’t keep Hollywood away. His songs can be hear
 d in feature films and television including Showtime’s <em>Masters of Sex<
 /em> and <em>Brotherhood</em>\, NBC’s <em>Scrubs</em> and <em>Parenthood</
 em>\, and the recent IFC film <em>Lucky Them</em>.</p>\n<p>Stage\, film an
 d television aside\, when Sexton isn’t touring he often mixes entertainmen
 t with his sense of social responsibility\, performing at benefits for Pau
 l Newman’s Hole in the Wall Gang camp\, the Children’s Tumor Foundation\, 
 Japan earthquake/tsunami relief (The John Lennon Tribute)\, Hurricane Iren
 e relief\, efforts in Vermont\, and Life Is Good Playmaker Charity\, to na
 me some. Billboard called Sexton’s version of “Working Class Hero” for the
  Lennon Tribute/benefit “chill-inspiring.”</p>\n<p>The majority of his rel
 eases have reached Billboard’s Heatseekers and Triple A charts. The Los An
 geles Times said “Call him a soul shatterer\, a soul poet\, a folkie or a 
 rocker and you wouldn’t be wrong.”</p>\n<p>After NBC anchor<strong> Brian 
 WIllians</strong> heard “Sugarcoating\,” he sought Martin out for an inter
 view backstage at New York’s Beacon Theater to discuss his music and criti
 cal views of the media. It’s now featured on MSNBC’s BriTunes.</p>\n<p><st

 iolinists of his era. His restless curiosity\, passion\, and multi-faceted
  musical interests have earned him the rare title of “classical music supe
 rstar.” Recently named the Music Director of the Academy of St Martin in t
 he Fields\, Bell is the first person to hold this post since Sir Neville M
 arriner formed the orchestra in 1958.</p>\n</p>\n<p>Equally at home as a s
 oloist\, chamber musician\, recording artist and orchestra leader\, Bell’s
  2014 summer highlights include performances with the Indianapolis and Det
 roit Symphonies and the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl. Ap
 pearances at Aspen\, Festival del Sole Napa\, Ravinia\, Verbier\, Salzburg
 \, Mostly Mozart and Tanglewood and two concerts with the New York Philhar
 monic in New York’s Central and the Bronx’s Van Cortland Parks round out t
 he summer. Bell kicks off the new season at the New York Philharmonic\, To
 ronto\, and National Symphony Orchestra galas. A U.S. and European recital

 on for a Washington Post story by Gene Weingarten examining art and contex
 t. The story earned Weingarten a Pulitzer Prize and sparked an internation
 al firestorm of discussion. The conversation continues to this day\, thank
 s in part to the September\, 2013 publication of the illustrated children’
 s book\, The Man With the Violin by Kathy Stinson illustrated by Dušan Pet
 ričić from Annick Press.<br />\nBell has been embraced by a wide televisio

 \, Bell was an avid computer game player. He placed fourth in a national t
 ennis tournament at age 10\, and still keeps his racquet close by. At age 
 four\, he received his first violin after his parents\, both mental health
  professionals\, noticed him plucking tunes with rubber bands he had stret
 ched around his dresser drawer handles. By 12\, he was serious about the i
 nstrument\, thanks in large part to the inspiration Josef Gingold\, his be
 loved teacher and mentor. Two years later\, Bell came to national attentio
 n in debut with Riccardo Muti and the Philadelphia Orchestra. His Carnegie
  Hall debut\, an Avery Fisher Career Grant and a notable recording contrac
 t further confirmed his presence.</p>\n<p>In 1989\, Bell received an Artis

 est singer-songwriters.”</strong></em> – The New Yorker</p>\n<p><strong>Da
 r Williams</strong> recorded her first full album\,<em> The Honesty Room</
 em>\, on her own label – Burning Fields Music.  Guest artists included <st
 rong>Nerissa</strong> and <strong>Katryna Nields</strong>\, <strong>Max Co
 hen</strong> and <strong>Gideon Freudmann</strong>. The record went on to 
 become one of the top-selling independent folk albums of 1995. 1996’s <em>
 Mortal City </em>received substantial notice\, partially due to the fact t
 hat it coincided with her tour with <strong>Joan Baez</strong>.  The album
  again featured guest appearances by the Nields sisters and Freudmann\, as
  well as noted folk artists <strong>John Prine</strong>\, <strong>Cliff Eb
 erhardt</strong> and <strong>Lucy Kaplansky</strong>.  By the time of her 
 third release\, <em>End of The Summer</em> (1997)\, Williams’ career had g
 athered substantial momentum\, and the album did remarkably well.</p>\n<p>
 In 1998\, Williams\, <strong>Richard Shindell</strong> and <strong>Lucy Ka
 plansky</strong> formed the group<strong> Cry Cry Cry</strong> as a way to
  pay homage to some of their favorite folk artists. The band released an e
 ponymous album of covers and toured from 1998 to 2000.</p>\n</p>\n<p>Every
  new album from Dar Williams represents her thoughts and feelings about bo
 th her own life and larger forces in the world. But her ninth studio recor
 d\, <em>Emerald</em>\, marks a particularly dramatic confluence between he
 r experiences and broader contemporary culture—and what it means to be a s
 ongwriter at this moment in history.</p>\n<p>In the past few years\, Willi
 ams has been involved in a wide range of different efforts and projects: t
 eaching a course titled “Music Movements in a Capitalist Democracy” at her
  alma mater\, Wesleyan University\; working with children at several summe
 r camps\; leading songwriting workshops\; getting involved with the workin
 gs of her village\; and writing a book about the ways she’s seen towns bec
 oming more independent and prosperous over her twenty years of touring. In
  addition\, in the face of dramatic transformations in the music industry\
 , she is releasing Emerald on her own after choosing to part ways with Raz
 or & Tie\, her label for almost twenty years.</p>\n<p>“It’s like the recor
 d business is a giant building that collapsed\,” says Williams\, “but when
  the building is destroyed\, you get to see what remains. And this incredi
 ble structure of the music and the friendships that I have is all still th
 ere. Seeing that led to a decision to record songs with themes about relat
 ionships and connections—I wanted to write songs for my friends and about 
 my friends.”</p>\n</p>\n<p>A scan of <em>Emerald’s</em> credits reveals th
 e strength of her bonds in the music community. Recorded in Nashville\; Lo
 s Angeles\; Philadelphia\; Beacon\, New York\; and Weehawken\, New Jersey\
 , the album features a remarkable list of guest musicians and co-writers\,
  including guitar virtuoso<strong> Richard Thompson</strong>\, <strong>Jim
  Lauderdale</strong>\, <strong>Eric Bazilian</strong> and<strong> Rob Hyma
 n</strong> of the <strong>Hooters</strong>\, and <strong>Suzzy</strong> an
 d <strong>Lucy Wainwright Roche</strong>.</p>\n<p>Even the song that set t
 he album in motion was the result of a meeting of the minds. As Williams w
 as preparing her Wesleyan course\, she played a show at which she shared a
  bill with <strong>Jill Sobule</strong>. “I told her about the era I was c
 overing\,” says Williams\, “and her incredible joy in talking about the ‘7
 0s and the way that we loved music then was the beginning of the song ‘FM 
 Radio.’ When I started to write it\, I immediately asked if she wanted to 
 do a co-write. It was a lot of great conversations on the phone\, one real
 ly fun day in New York City\, and one really fun day in the studio.”</p>\n
 </p>\n<p>Where her last album\, 2011’s <em>In the Time of Gods</em>\, was 
 an ambitious and evocative series of songs that melded the imagery and nar
 ratives of classical mythology with modern issues and themes\, most of the
  inspiration on<em> Emerald</em> was concrete and immediate. She began wri
 ting “Mad River” during the Occupy Wall Street actions\, based on a real-l
 ife example of current economic dysfunction.</p>\n<p>“I heard about this g
 uy who had a job at a school\, lost the job\, and then got it back because
  it had been outsourced—he was stripped of benefits and getting half the p
 ay for the same job\, and he kind of went under\,” she says. “It was a rec
 ognition that we’re not in balance right now. But I also wanted it to have
  a feeling of brotherhood around this protagonist\, so that’s why I wanted
  <strong>Milk Carton Kids</strong> to play on it\, because they bring that
  spirit\, that brotherly sense of honor\, into their music.”</p>\n<p>A cov
 er of <strong>Joe Strummer’s</strong> rousing “Johnny Appleseed” reflects 
 Williams’ work planting gardens at summer camps\, while “Girl of the World
 ” was the result of a trip to Honduras\, where a friend of hers is making 
 a documentary about the lives of some local young women.</p>\n<p>“I wrote 
 a song for them that was very ballad-y\, and that’s on the record\, but th
 ese girls love <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>\, and I thought\, ‘I can’t ju
 st do acoustic folk for these teenage girls!\,’ “ she says with a laugh. “
 One great thing about working on my own is that if I want to do my iterati
 on of a Taylor Swift song\, then there’s no rule that says I can’t. So I w
 rote and recorded something in Nashville with <strong>Angel Snow</strong>\
 , and we all had to figure out where it lived—in folk\, in country\, in po
 p—and in the end\, we just did what we wanted and it sounds like a Dar son
 g.”</p>\n</p>\n<p>The final song she cut for the album is “New York Is a H
 arbor\,” a reflection on the city that looms largest in America’s imaginat
 ion. ”There is something special about the feeling of a neighborhood\, the
  feeling of things that are built locally. I think we all understand that 
 moment when the local thing is turned into a commercial version of itself\
 ,” she says. “New York is struggling\; it’s just so precious that everybod
 y wants it. I’m not blaming one person or another\, it’s just too expensiv
 e—but that doesn’t mean we can’t hold on to the ideal of the neighborhoods
  and the people who created them.</p>\n<p>“A lot of people have not given 
 up on the positive diversity of incomes\, mental wavelengths\, and dreams 
 in New York. Also\, in light of the things going on in my town at the time
 \, I wanted to reinvigorate the sense that people have power as storytelle
 rs and active citizens to keep that diversity alive.”</p>\n<p>If friendshi
 p and human connection lie at the heart of<em> Emerald</em>\, Williams had
  to put these ideas to a very real test when she decided to crowd-fund the
  making of the album through Pledge Music. While it was an adjustment gett
 ing used to sharing as much as possible from the album’s sessions with her
  fans and followers\, she enjoyed the opportunities for interaction.</p>\n
 <p>“Pledge for me is like swimming in a pool\,” she says. “My fans are sma
 rter than I am\, I like being around them\, so I said\, ‘Whatever you want
  me to do\, I’ll do it.’ When we started thinking about\, ‘How do you want
  to fundraise for the album?\,’ it was actually a very fun discussion. I h
 eard that people want to know about the recording process. I had kind of f
 orgotten the wonderful Alice in Wonderland feeling of first coming into th
 e studio twenty years ago\, and the Pledge campaign reminded me.”</p>\n<p>
 It’s a cliché that the personal is the political\, but for Dar Williams\, 
 there really is no separating her life from her worldview. And in the face
  of a shifting world\, she is more aware than ever of the power this appro
 ach can create.</p>\n<p>“I’m now experiencing the fruits of the alternativ
 e culture I was part of in the ‘90s\,” she says. “I think I’ve made choice
 s about how I lived my life\, outside of the world that was going to fit m
 e among the mainstream norms\, and I chose to stay with my friends\, to st
 ay with my culture.</p>\n<p>“That turns out to have been the sturdiest str
 ucture I could have built for myself. And that’s in my songs\, it’s in my 
 teaching. I’m a believer in what can happen when we make music together.”<

  “From the Ancient Storm” to Triple A radio across\, America\, Canada\, UK
 \, Australia and New Zealand along with a track from her 2014 album called
  <em>Revolution</em>. Simrit describes the songs as a journey of change\, 
 “First there is a revolution that occurs\, change within\, then comes comp

  comes to the point of surrendering to love in some way. That is what thes

 uments in his arsenal\, and concentrated on just one of the styles he has 
 mastered and/or mutated\, he would doubtless be considered one of the best
  and most original practitioners of that one thing. Instead\, over the pas
 t five decades he has studied\, investigated\, incorporated\, and become a
 n original\, prominent voice in styles spanning the globe\, on so many ins
 truments he lost count long ago. In the process\, he has expanded the para
 meters of popular music\, stylistically and instrumentally\, to a degree t
 hat few\, if any\, can claim.”</strong></em> – Vintage Guitar Magazine</p>
 \n<p><em><strong>“Whether playing switchbacks on his lap steels\, hot rodd

  is arguably one of the most talented stringed instrument players alive\, 
 demonstrating a bone-deep rapport with his instruments.”</strong></em> – S
 anta Barbara News-Press</p>\n<p>Multi-instrumentalist David Lindley perfor
 ms music that redefines the word “eclectic.” Lindley\, well known for his 
 many years as the featured accompanist with Jackson Browne\, and leader of
  his own band El Rayo-X\, has long championed the concept of world music. 
 The David Lindley electro-acoustic performance effortlessly combines Ameri
 can folk\, blues\, and bluegrass traditions with elements from African\, A
 rabic\, Asian\, Celtic\, Malagasy\, and Turkish musical sources. Lindley i
 ncorporates an incredible array of stringed instruments including but not 
 limited to Kona and Weissenborn Hawaiian lap steel guitar\, Turkish saz an
 d chumbus\, Middle Eastern oud\, and Irish bouzouki. The eye-poppingly cla
 d “Mr. Dave’s” uncanny vocal mimicry and demented sense of humor make his 
 onstage banter a highlight of the show.</p>\n</p>\n<p>David Lindley grew u
 p in southern California\, first taking up the banjo as a teenager\, and s
 ubsequently winning the annual Topanga canyon banjo and fiddle contest fiv
 e times as he explored the American folk music tradition. between 1967 and
  1971 Lindley founded and lead what must now be seen as the first world mu
 sic rock band\, the Kaleidoscope. In 1971\, Mr. Dave joined forces with Ja
 ckson Browne\, serving as Jackson’s most significant musical co-conspirato
 r until 1981. In 1979\, Lindley had begun working with old friend Ry Coode
 r on ‘Bop Till you Drop’ and ‘The Long Riders’ sound track\, a musical col
 laboration that lasts to this day\, and has spawned many recording project
 s and several world tours as an acoustic duo.</p>\n</p>\n<p>In 1981\, Lind
 ley created his own remarkable Band El Rayo-X\, which integrated American 
 roots music and world beat with a heavy reggae influence. ‘El Rayo-X’\, ‘W
 in This Record’ and ‘Very Greasy’\, as well as a live e.p. During this per
 iod he also came forth with a solo album\, ‘Mr. Dave’.</p>\n<p>Lindley and
  guitarist Henry Kaiser went to Madagascar for two weeks in 1991 and recor
 ded six albums of indigenous Malagasy music (including two collaborative c
 d’s\, ‘A World Out of Time’ volumes one and two on Shanachie) which proved
  to have a major impact on the world music scene\, both for the quality of
  the Grammy nominated music recorded\, and the fair and ethical way the Ma
 lagasy musicians were dealt with. Throughout this long and distinguished c
 areer\, Lindley has been one of Hollywood’s most in demand session musicia
 ns\, lending his skills to the recorded works of Bob Dylan\, Rod Stewart\,
  Linda Ronstadt\, Crosby and Nash\, Warren Zevon\, and many others.</p>\n<
 /p>\n<p>In 1990 a chance meeting of Lindley and Jordanian born percussioni
 st Hani Naser led to an impromptu jam and an instant decision that “we sho
 uld take this on the road.” David and Hani toured the world for the follow
 ing six years. The duo recorded two self-released “Official Bootleg” compa
 ct discs\, ‘Live in Tokyo Playing Real Good’ and ‘Live All Over the Place 
 Playing Even Better’ on Pleemhead Audio.</p>\n<p>At his expansive and ecle
 ctic live performances David Lindley consistently gives one of the most un
 ique concert experiences available to adventuresome music listeners.</p>\n

 </strong> and guitarist <strong>Ryan Francesconi</strong> have uniquely co
 llaborated to create <em>Cold Moon</em>. The two musicians talked at a fri
 end’s show in October 2014\, chatting about how they were both experiencin
 g creative standstills. Ryan was lacking inspiration to make more instrume
 ntal music\, and Alela was at a loss for how to dive into writing a new re
 cord after the birth of her daughter. A few days later\, Ryan asked Alela 
 if she would be into collaborating and then sent her several recordings of
  intricate\, beautiful guitar pieces. Alela listened on repeat while stari
 ng out the window at the changing leaves\, initially unsure how to sing ev
 en a note over what she heard. Eventually\, something clicked. Words came 
 first\, and with words\, melody followed. Throughout the winter\, Alela ma
 de trips across town to Ryan’s house to woodshed the songs over cups of te
 a. Before they knew it\, they had a record–a collaboration of voice and gu
 itar with intangible moods and resonances–a collection that calls you to r
 eflect and be hopeful.</p>\n</p>\n<p>A wintry music born in December. And 
 so rose the <em>Cold Moon</em>.</p>\n<p>Alela Diane is a critically-acclai
 med singer/songwriter from Nevada City\, CA currently living in Portland\,
  Oregon. She’s released four albums including “The Pirate’s Gospel” in 200
 7\, “To Be Still” in 2009\, “Wild Divine” in 2011 and “About Farewell” in 
 2013.</p>\n</p>\n<p>Ryan Francesconi is a composer\, guitarist\, balkan mu
 sician\, programmer\, and cyclist living in Portland\, Oregon. Recent proj
 ects include arranging <strong>Joanna Newsom’s</strong> “Have One On Me”\,
  a solo guitar record “Parables”\, and “Road To Palios” – his latest album
  of duets with <strong>Mirabai Peart</strong> released by Bella Union.</p>

 trong></p>\n<p>“I heard somebody say that ‘the brightest lights cast the b
 iggest shadows\,’ so honey\, I’ve got to let you go\, I’ve got to let you 
 go”. …So croons the elegant folkstress Alela Diane on the title number fro
 m her forthcoming record\, <em>About Farewell</em>. Over the last year\, A
 lela has finished recording and mixing this new album\, to be self-release
 d in the summer via her own label\, Rusted Blue Records. It serves as an e
 loquent goodbye to lovers from years past\, coupled with some poignant las
 t walks down memory lane. While the lyrics deal most directly with her rec
 ent divorce\, the album explores her entire last decade of relationships w
 ith tremendous honesty and nuanced insight.</p>\n<p>To call the experience
  “cathartic” would almost be an understatement – for Alela\, this was a re
 cord which direly needed to be made. In the writing process\, she was able
  to lucidly articulate her emotions about her marriage\, a process which l
 ed her to realize the necessity of ending one chapter of her life in order
  to begin a new one. Her art helped to guide her\, as ever\, along the pro
 per path. The process of writing and recording <em>About Farewell</em> cem
 ented her intention to say a firm goodbye. Yet in releasing it – surrender
 ing it to the world – this songbird can find new levity with that weight o
 ff her wings. She’s flying towards what the French call l’avenir – the “ye
 t to come.”</p>\n<p>These songs are somber and achingly truthful\, yet alw
 ays glimmering with her exquisite poetry. In these new songs\, Alela’s sta
 ggering voice is able to take center stage\, as she’s turned away from the
  full band that she last employed with <em>Alela Diane & Wild Divine</em>.
  The entirety of <em>About Farewell</em> was built around her voice and si
 mple guitar arrangements. With an unprecedented level of creative control\
 , Alela could explore her own ideas for harmonies and melodies and create 
 a wholly unique piece of self-expression.</p>\n<p>While the record is a st
 ep forward for her in this way\, it also represents a return to her roots 
 as a songwriter. Hailing from Nevada City\, CA\, the homespun charms of he
 r origin place have never left her. Alela’s first record\, <em>The Pirate’
 s Gospel</em>\, featured hand-drawn and hand-sewn sleeves. It is this hand
 crafted DIY aesthetic which is revisited anew\, both in her decision to se
 lf-release the album\, and in her self-possessed approach to recording.</p
 >\n<p>Alela laid much of <em>About Farewell</em> to tape with<strong> John
  Askew</strong> at Flora Recording Studios in her current home of Portland
 \, Ore\, in late 2011 and early 2012. Over the course of 2012 she enlisted
  the help of some very talented friends to flesh out the sound: <strong>He
 ather Broderick</strong> (Horse Feathers\, Efterklang\, Loch Lomond) arran
 ging and playing piano and flute\, <strong>Holcombe Waller</strong> arrang
 ing strings\, and <strong>Neal Morgan</strong> (Joanna Newsom\, Bill Calla
 han touring bands) playing drums. In early 2013\, she finished mixing the 
 album with John Askew at Scenic Burrows and Mix Foundry.</p>\n<p>We find t
 hese stripped-down folk songs to be a perfect vehicle for Alela’s impressi
 ve emotional range. She’s able to convey heartrending vulnerability at one
  moment\, then bold wisdom and unflinching directness at the next. Nowhere
  is this palette so rich as in the live shows\, an intimate treat for audi
 ences lucky enough to catch her this year. In the season of spring\, the h
 eart has thawed and we turn to the promise of budding possibilities. A onc
 e-heartsick Alela has said her farewells\, and now is the time to meet the
  new\, more fully actualized woman.</p>\n<p><strong>RYAN FRANCESCONI</stro
 ng></p>\n<p>Portland based composer and guitarist Ryan Francesconi became 
 obsessed with Balkan folk music via dissecting Bela Bartok scores in colle
 ge. While own music has been colored by unusual rhythms and harmonies sinc
 e he was a teenager\, his work with his bands The Toids and Trio Mopmu bro
 ught his somewhat skewed perspective to the attention of the Balkan commun
 ity. Often referred to as a multi-instrumentalist\, he is a specialist on 
 the Bulgarian Tambura as well various other stringed things. Over the year
 s touring with <strong>Joanna Newsom</strong>\, he’s brought a bit more at
 tention to the tambura and kaval\, perhaps being one of the few people to 
 play them at Carnegie Hall\, The Sydney Opera House\, Royal Albert Hall\, 
 Red Rocks\, Austin City Limits\, among other fancy places.</p>\n<p>He has 
 studied formally and informally\, obtaining a MFA in composition from Cali
 fornia Institute of the Arts and an ass kicking in Tambura studies from <s
 trong>Lyubo Vladimirov</strong> in Sofia. In his recent compositions\, he 
 has focused primarily on fingerstyle acoustic guitar\, touring internation
 ally both solo and with violinist <strong>Mirabai Peart</strong>. They rec
 ently released an album of duets on Bella Union entitled ” Parables “\, an
 d ” Road To Palios “. Recent other records include “Songs From The Cedar H
 ouse”\, an album of oud and tambura duets with Kane Mathis\, a jazz releas
 e “Mercury Falls”\, Joanna Newsom’s Have One On Me “\, and his solo guitar
  record ” Parables “.</p>\n</div>\n<p> </p>

 p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>CD RELEASE TOUR</strong><br />\n<em><strong>The Tra
 ckless Woods</strong></em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>It was by pure chance that <str
 ong>Iris DeMent</strong> opened the book of Russian poetry sitting on her 
 piano bench to <strong>Anna Akhmatova’s</strong> “Like A White Stone.” She
 ’d never heard of the poet before\, and didn’t even consider herself much 
 of a poetry buff\, but a friend had leant her the anthology and it only se
 emed polite that she skim it enough to have something interesting to say w
 hen she returned it. As she read\, though\, a curious sensation swept over
  her.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t feel like I was alone anymore\,” remembers DeMent.
  “I felt as if somebody walked in the room and said to me\, ‘Set that to m
 usic.’”</p>\n</p>\n<p>So she did. The melody just poured out of her almost
  instantly. She turned the page and it happened again\, and again after th
 at\, and before she even fully understood it\, she was already deep into w
 riting what would become ‘The Trackless Woods\,’ an album which sets Akhma
 tova’s poetry to music for the first time ever.</p>\n<p>‘The Trackless Woo
 ds\,’ DeMent’s sixth studio album\, is unlike anything else in her illustr
 ious career. Beginning with her 1992 debut\, ‘Infamous Angel\,’ which was 
 hailed as “an essential album of the 1990’s” by Rolling Stone\, DeMent rel
 eased a series of stellar records that established her as “one of the fine
 st singer-songwriters in America” according to The Guardian. The music ear
 ned her multiple Grammy nominations\, as well as the respect of peers like
  John Prine\, Steve Earle\, and Emmylou Harris\, who all invited her to co
 llaborate. Merle Haggard dubbed her “the best singer I’ve ever heard” and 
 asked her to join his touring band\, and David Byrne and Natalie Merchant 
 famously covered her “Let The Mystery Be” as a duet on MTV Unplugged. DeMe
 nt returned in 2012 with her most recent album\, ‘Sing The Delta\,’ which 
 prompted NPR to call her “one of the great voices in contemporary popular 
 music” and The Boston Globe to hail the collection as “a work of rare\, un
 varnished grace and power.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile\, behind the scenes\, DeMent
  and her husband were raising their adopted Russian daughter in their Iowa
  City home. When she looked back on her own childhood\, though\, DeMent so
 metimes felt like there was some intangible element that hadn’t quite clic
 ked yet.</p>\n</p>\n<p>“Growing up\, a lot of what I understood about my p
 arents—and many of the adults in my life that were nurturing me—I understo
 od through music\,” explains DeMent\, who was born the youngest of 14 chil
 dren in Arkansas and raised in southern California. “I remember noticing t
 hat people seem to be most their real selves when they were in the music. 
 My dad would cry my mom would wave her arms around when they sang church m
 usic. So I figured out at some point that there was a breakdown there with
  my daughter. She was six when we adopted her\, and there was a whole cult
 ure that had been translated to her in those critical years that I didn’t 
 feel like I could get through to with the tools I had. So always in the ba
 ck of my mind\, I had this sense of wanting to figure out how to link her 
 two worlds\, Russian and American.”</p>\n<p>Akhmatova’s poetry proved to b
 e that link and more\, as it drew DeMent into a remarkable journey through
  Russian political and artistic history.</p>\n<p>“Her whole adult working 
 life was marked by this constant struggle to do her work in the face of th
 e Bolshevik Revolution\, World War I\, World War II\, and Stalin\,” DeMent
  says of Akhmatova. “The estimates are that between 20-80 million people d
 ied during those 30 years he was in power. One of her husbands was execute
 d\, one died in the gulag\, and her son was sent there twice just by virtu
 e of being her son. She often lived in poverty and out of other people’s h
 omes\, never owned a place of her own. She wasn’t some elevated star figur
 e exempted from suffering\, she was right there in it. All of her poetry c
 ame out of that.”</p>\n<p>Akhmatova’s struggles weren’t unique for her tim
 e in Russia\, but her poetry still managed to find beauty in a world of pa
 in and ugliness\, which DeMent believes is what makes her so deeply loved 
 by the Russian people.</p>\n<p>“I think if you listen to her poems\, you c
 an hear all that sorrow and that burden in them\,” says DeMent\, “but ther
 e’s always a lightness\, a transcendence somehow\, a sense of victory over
  all that inhumanity that she was living with every day of her life.”</p>
 \n<p>It’s only fitting\, then\, that the album opens with\, “To My Poems\,
 ” a short\, four-line invocation recorded sparsely and simply with just De
 Ment’s voice and piano as she sings: “You led me into the trackless woods\
 , / My falling stars\, my dark endeavor. / You were bitterness\, lies\, a 
 bill of goods. / You weren’t a consolation–ever.”</p>\n<p>That stark pairi
 ng of piano and voice forms the heart and soul of all 18 tracks on the alb
 um\, which were recorded live in DeMent’s living room under the guidance o
 f producer Richard Bennett and with a small backing band that drifts in an
 d out of the arrangements. The music is firmly rooted in the American Sout
 h\, with timeless melodies that could easily be mistaken for long-forgotte
 n hymnal entries or classic country tunes. “From An Airplane” rollicks wit
 h a honky-tonk vibe\, while “Not With Deserters” is punctuated by a mournf
 ul slide guitar and rich harmonies\, and “All Is Sold” ebbs and flows over
  lush pedal steel. That DeMent can make the work of a 20th century Russian
  poet sound like Sunday morning on a cotton plantation is a testament to h
 er versatility and depth as an artist.</p>\n<p>“I learned from this projec
 t that I don’t have just one voice\, I have lots of voices\, and they’re a
 ll connected somehow\,” says DeMent. “Something happened on this record be
 cause the music wasn’t tied to a place from my past or my family history\,
  but it was linked to my daughter by way of her cultural history. I realiz
 ed writing these songs that I’m linked in some way to another world\, as w
 ell\, and I can hear it in the music\, in the way I sang and the choices I
  made.”</p>\n<p>DeMent is quick to credit Akhmatova (and the translators w
 hose work formed the album’s lyrics\, Babette Deutsch and Lyn Coffin) for 
 the album’s beauty and magic.</p>\n<p>“All of the poems\, particularly Bab
 ette’s translations\, just felt like songs to me from the get go\,” says D
 eMent. “The first four or five I did\, the melodies came while I was readi
 ng them the first time. That still mystifies me. My gut sense is that they
  were songs\, already. I think she wrote them that way\, and Babette picke
 d up on that. They flowed like that. I don’t think there’s any getting aro
 und that the music was already in the poems.”</p>\n<p>There’s no getting a
 round that the music is in DeMent\, too. Twenty-three years after her debu
 t\, she’s creating some of the most poignant music of her career\, bridgin
 g two seemingly disparate worlds with every note.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=

 iety.</strong></em><em><strong> It’s the rise of a past lifestyle that is 
 still rooted to the land. Drive up to one of the group’s shows in a fancy 
 car\, and you’ll want to leave on foot. And that’s the goal. By resurrecti
 ng and reinventing their parents’ nostalgic old folk and mountain music\, 
 sisters Leah and Chloe Smith pave the way back to lost simplicities and so
 cial responsibility.”</strong></em> – Paste Magazine</p>\n<p>Sisters Leah 
 Song and Chloe Smith tear into sound with sensual prowess as stages ignite
  revolutions and words light up soul fires. Listen to their beautiful soun
 d for banjo and fiddle duets and poetic harmonies like only sisters can do
 … Joined full-time by their beloved band\, Biko Casini on percussion\, and
  David Brown on stand up bass and baritone guitar\, expect everything from
  folk standards to jazz\, to New Orleans soul\, to old mountain traditiona
 ls\, to activist anthems\, as their style redefines folk music as a truly 
 living art. Using sound as a tool to spark a cultural revolution and birth
  a new movement\, come join them as they create soul sounds for us all.</p
 >\n</p>\n<p>Having toured over 25\,000 miles across the US\, and graced ma
 ny stages around the world\, Rising Appalachia’s vision and sound is quick
 ly proving to be contagious to everyone it touches. Their shows have inclu
 ded and array of community-run venues and collective events\, as well as t
 he Kennedy Center in Washington DC\, NPR’s All Songs Considered\, E-town\,
  The School of America Vigil\, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass\, Emory Universit

 Radio Popular Verona\, Italy\, Guerilla Radio Amsterdam\, The Edinburgh Fr
 inge Festival\, The Highlander Center 75th Reunion\, Burning Man\, Urkult 
 (Sweden)\, and Festa Del Fuoco (Stromboli Italy) and many more.</p>\n</p>
 \n<p>Their prolific self-sculpted career has included 6 independently rele
 ased full length albums\, including their brand new album Wider Circles\, 
 and has sculpted a path for a new generation of music aficionados. Having 
 been raised in the American South with Appalachian lullabies at night and 
 soul music for breakfast Sisters Leah and Chloe have drawn great inspirati
 on from their global community. Their mother and father claimed art and mu
 sic as a full part of their lives and the girls have been shaped by the so
 unds of the South. They have continued to use those powerful roots to find
  musical connections and community around the world.</p>\n</p>\n<p>“Music 
 is the tool with which we wield political prowess. Melody for the Roots of
  each of us…spreading song and sound around the globe. Music has become ou
 r script for vision… not just for aural pleasure\, not just for hobby-but 
 now as a means to connect and create in ways that we aren’t taught by main
 stream culture…we are building community and tackling social injustice thr
 ough melody- making the stage reach out with octopus arms to gather a grea
 t family. It is taking its own personality\, carrying us all along the jou
 rney down the damp and strange alley ways and cryptic coded pathways… to p
 oetic observations\, social change\, lyrical messages\, political rage\, s
 ymphonic coercing\, ferocious bantering\, bicycles and train tracks\, prim
 al will\, fresh air intoxicants\, harmony and alliteration\, noise and som
 ething sweeter than words can ever touch. ” Leah Song.</p>\n</p>\n<p>Risin
 g Appalachia has been voted “Green Album of the Year” by the Huffington Po
 st and Atlanta’s Best Folk Act by the Creative Loafing\, and have been wri
 tten up in Paste Magazine\, The New York Times\, The Performer Magazine\, 
 Dirty Linen\, Sing Out\, Anti-Gravity\, Maverick and more. Their tours hav
 e taken them across Europe\, through the Caribbean\, into Central America\
 , into the Indian subcontinent\, and across the United States making sacre
 d sounds and elaborate stages wherever they go. They are creatively commit
 ted to keeping their work accessible at the local\, street level\, as well
  as expanding to larger audiences abroad\, and have continued to maintain 
 autonomy by self- managing\, recording\, producing and creating\, and dire
 cting their work. They are greatly honored to do the work that they do.</p

 <em><strong>“Brooklyn based band\, The Pimps of Joytime\, have established
  themselves as one of the most acclaimed live funk acts currently touring.
  Since their formation in 2005\, they are one of those groups that tends t
 o tour non-stop. The excitement was in the air long before they took the s
 tage on the second night of their two-night run at The Independent in San 
 Francisco. The Pimps easily stir up any crowd on any night into a full blo
 wn dancing frenzy within moments of taking the stage. Their eclectic mix o
 f funk\, soul\, reggae\, latin\, and electronica make them one of a kind.<
 /strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Comparisons can be made (Parliament and 
 Sly come to mind\, or pretty much any great funk band you can think of wit
 h incredible showmanship)\, but frankly The Pimps are in a category all th
 eir own\; something new and fresh to behold. They have the energy\, the co
 mmitment\, the stage presence\, the excellent musicianship and even the lu
 ck of good looks on top of all that to inspire a rockin’ party.”</strong><

 /tbody>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p>If you have yet to encounter the Brooklyn-ba
 sed band\, <strong>Pimps of Joytime</strong>\, prepare to take a funky rid
 e! The PJT’s live events and recordings have captivated fans all across th
 e country\, as they have begun writing their own success story\, show-by-s
 how\, and track-by-track.</p>\n</p>\n<p>Bandleader <strong>Brian J</strong
 > is a charismatic and soulful visionary\, whose well-crafted songs invite
  the listener to enter a world of infectious dance grooves and indelible m
 elodies. Spending formative years in New York City\, New Orleans and Los A
 ngeles\, Mista J honed his craft\, becoming an accomplished live performer
 \, multi-instrumentalist and producer.</p>\n</p>\n<p>In 2005\, Brian began
  to assemble a group of righteously soulful vocalists and musicians to ass
 ist in bringing to life the musical concept that would become Pimps of Joy
 time. The band’s diverse sound and spirited attitude is strongly influence
 d by the Brooklyn DJ culture and live music scene from which they emerge. 
 Recent collaborations with legendary artists <strong>Cyril</strong> and <s
 trong>Art Neville</strong> of the <strong>Neville Brothers</strong> and <s
 trong>Roy Ayers</strong> have helped vitalize the band’s connection to its
  roots.</p>\n</p>\n<p>Over the course of the past five years\, the Pimps h
 ave evolved into a road tested and audience approved groove machine. They 
 have excited crowds at over 100 club dates and festivals in 2012 alone\, a
 nd are on target to exceed that volume in 2013. The exponential growth of 
 the band’s fan base can be partially attributed to an artful blend of musi
 cal styles\, including elements of afro-beat\, salsa\, rock & roll and ele
 ctronica. Brian J’s classic songwriting and the band’s undeniable swagger 
 on stage consistently energize dance parties wherever they appear.</p>\n<p
 >In 2011\, Pimps of Joytime released their second studio album\, Janxta Fu
 nk! through the boutique label Wonderwheel Recordings. With a steadily inc
 reasing repertoire and a passionate following of music lovers nationwide\,
  the time was right to fortify their organization. The wall of their Faceb
 ook page is constantly receiving enthusiastic posts from fans from around 
 the globe as word of mouth further carries news of this fresh new arrival.
 </p>\n</p>\n<p>The Pimps of Joytime are poised to bring their audacious so
 und to savvy audiences around the planet. Their forthcoming third studio a
 lbum coming this fall will be a new chapter in the book of the Funk and a 
 testament to the fact that real music is alive and kicking!</p>\n<p><stron

 CON BRIO</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Con Brio</strong> is a living\, evolving
  testament to the power of soul. Propelled by the young phenom <strong>Zie
 k McCarter</strong> – a charismatic\, undeniably gifted showman – Con Brio
 ’s sound draws a clear lineage from the dance-heavy funk legacies of legen
 ds like <strong>Sly & the Family Stone</strong> and <strong>James Brown</s
 trong>\, while keeping an eye on R&B trailblazers like <strong>D’Angelo</s
 trong> and <strong>Prince</strong> and a focus firmly on the future.</p>\n
 </p>\n<p>Based in San Francisco and named after a musical direction meanin
 g “with spirit”\, Con Brio has a relentless drive for experimentation\, fo
 r pushing their high technical ability higher\, for reaching beyond the fa
 miliar. The resulting dynamic fuses pulsating rhythms\, blazing guitar-wor
 k\, soaring horns\, the warm peal of a Hammond organ\, and shimmering\, su
 ltry vocals with an unforgettable stage presence and seemingly limitless e
 nergy: altogether it’s one hell of a party.</p>\n<p>In 2013\, the longstan
 ding rhythm section of keyboardist <strong>Micah Dubreuil</strong>\, bassi
 st <strong>Jonathan Kirchner</strong> and drummer <strong>Andrew Laubacher
 </strong> joined forces with incomparable guitar slinger <strong>Benjamin 
 Andrews</strong> and McCarter: a Texas transplant who as a 19-year-old had
  already begun drawing crowds in his new hometown. Add in the fireworks of
  the “Hallelujah Horns” (<strong>Marcus Stephens</strong> & <strong>Brenda
 n Liu</strong>) and you have the skill and confidence that comes from year
 s of stage time and deeply-established musical partnerships with the thirs
 t and energy of a rising star – a bright light who’s just getting started.
 </p>\n<p>Thanks to a legion of dedicated fans (who reliably show up to tea
 r the house down at every available opportunity)\, the band has shared the
  stage with artists such as Karl Denson’s Tiny Universe\, Fishbone\, Meshe
 ll Ndegeocello\, and Trombone Shorty. The release of the Kiss The Sun EP i
 n February of 2015 marked the beginning of Con Brio’s North American touri
 ng and ambitious performance and release schedule.</p>\n<p><strong><a href

 – San Francisco Chronicle</strong></p>\n<p>With sardonic wit and incisive 
 social critiques\, David Sedaris has become one of America’s pre-eminent h
 umor writers. The great skill with which he slices through cultural euphem
 isms and political correctness proves that Sedaris is a master of satire a
 nd one of the most observant writers addressing the human condition today.
 </p>\n<p>David Sedaris is the author <em>Barrel Fever</em> and <em>Holiday
 s on Ice</em>\, as well as collections of personal essays\, <em>Naked\,</e
 m> <em>Me Talk Pretty One Day\,</em> <em>Dress Your Family in Corduroy and
  Denim</em>\, and <em>When You Are Engulfed in Flames\,</em> each of which
  became a bestseller.  There are a total of seven million copies of his bo
 oks in print and they have been translated into 25 languages.  He was the 
 editor of <em>Children Playing Before a Statue of Hercules: An Anthology o
 f Outstanding Stories</em>.  Sedaris’s pieces appear regularly in <em>The 
 New Yorker</em> and have twice been included in The Best American Essays. 
  His newest book\, a collection of fables entitled <em>Squirrel Seeks Chip
 munk: A Modest Bestiary</em> (with illustrations by Ian Falconer)\, was pu
 blished in September 2010 and immediately hit the <em>NYT</em> Bestseller 
 Fiction List.</p>\n</p>\n<p>He and his sister\, Amy Sedaris\, have collabo
 rated under the name The Talent Family and have written half-a-dozen plays
  which have been produced at La Mama\, Lincoln Center\, and The Drama Depa
 rtment in New York City. These plays include <em>Stump the Host</em>\, <em
 >Stitches</em>\, <em>One Woman Shoe</em>\, which received an Obie Award\, 
 <em>Incident at Cobbler’s Knob</em>\, and <em>The Book of Liz</em>\, which
  was published in book form by Dramatists Play Service.  David Sedaris’s o
 riginal radio pieces can often be heard on <em>This American Life</em>\, d
 istributed nationally by Public Radio International and produced by WBEZ. 
  David Sedaris has been nominated for three Grammy Awards for Best Spoken 
 Word and Best Comedy Album.  His latest audio recording of new stories (re
 corded live) is David Sedaris: Live for Your Listening Pleasure (November 
 2009).</p>\n</p>\n<p><strong><a href='http://www.facebook.com/davidsedaris

 g more than Masekela’s trumpet and voice and Willis’ piano playing I\, alo
 ng with the couple hundred in the audience\, were treated to the performan
 ce of a lifetime…I just don’t feel my vocabulary is vast enough to express
  the greatness that the two old friends displayed on that stage. But a onc
 e-in-a-lifetime feeling fell over me listening to these two treasures\, an
 d listening to Masekela tell tales of hanging out in Harlem and playing wi
 th Miles Davis and the stories he told of Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gilles
 pie and Sarah Vaughn. It was like getting a first-hand lesson in music his
 tory\, delivered by one of the deans of the college.”</strong></em> – Insi
 ghtNews.com</p>\n<p><strong>Hugh Masekela & Larry Willis</strong><br />\nT
 rumpet great <strong>Hugh Masekela</strong> and piano master <strong>Larry
  Willis</strong> unite for a celebration of the Great American Songbook! O
 nce classmates at the Manhattan School of Music\, the two took slightly di
 fferent paths: Masekela scored some hit singles before turning his attenti
 on to the political climate in his native South Africa\, while Willis has 
 had an admirable career based in New York\, spanning the free jazz\, fusio
 n\, and post-bop movements of the past fifty years. Now they reunite with 
 a new recording\, the 4-disc <em>Friends</em>\, and a string of intimate d
 ates that showcase both artists’ virtuosity and immense emotional capacity
 .</p>\n<p>One of the important figures in South African music\, Hugh Masek
 ela is also one of its biggest personalities. He has been performing\, rec
 ording\, and fighting apartheid for over five decades\, and has worked wit
 h the Who’s Who of South African and international musicians.</p>\n</p>\n<
 p><strong>Hugh Masekela</strong><br />\nMasekela started on trumpet at an 
 early age and\, with some friends\, he started the Huddleston Jazz Band\, 
 South Africa’s first youth orchestra. He worked regularly in South African
  bands until 1960\, when the increased brutality of the apartheid state fo
 rced him to move. With the help of friends such as violinist Yehudi Menuhi
 n and conductor John Dankworth\, Masekela earned a scholarship to London’s
  Guildhall School of Music\, and South African singer Miriam Makeba helped
  him get to the Manhattan School of Music in New York. Once in the United 
 States\, his recording schedule became very full. His contributions to Mak
 eba’s records make them the best in her catalog\, and his solo records fro
 m this period are an amazing conflation of 1960s pop and African influence
 s. His 1968 hit “Grazing in the Grass” is a staple of this period.</p>\n<p
 >The 1970s and 1980s saw a number of high-profile events: a meeting with F
 ela Kuti spurred Masekela to explore his Afrobeat roots\, and his 1980 reu
 nion concert with Miriam Makeba in Lesotho was attended by seventy-five th
 ousand people. His two records with Herb Alpert are revered\, and his cont
 ributions to Paul Simon’s Graceland make the record the landmark that it i
 s. Today\, very little has changed for Masekela\, as he continues to sprea
 d his musical message of peace\, harmony\, and unity throughout the world.
 <br />\n“A musician of phenomenal grace and power: intricate and fiery on 
 flugelhorn and still blessed with a voice that can strip the leaves from t
 he trees.”—The Independent (U.K.)</p>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Larry Willis</stro
 ng><br />\nUpon graduating from the Manhattan School of Music in the mid-1
 960s\, pianist Larry Willis immediately became a force on the New York ava
 nt-garde jazz scene. His playing—bold\, frenetic\, and ambitious—found a h
 ome in the free jazz scene and also landed Willis recording dates with Lee
  Morgan\, Jackie McLean\, and Stan Getz. A longtime devotee of Herbie Hanc
 ock\, Willis moved into jazz-rock and fusion\, eventually joining the band

 a festive\, nondenominational holiday album with music from around the glo
 be. “There are 14 songs on Joy to the World\,” says <strong>Thomas Lauderd
 ale</strong>\, “including well-known traditional holiday songs like <stron
 g>Irving Berlin’s</strong> “White Christmas” sung by <strong>China Forbes<
 /strong> in English and by the incredible <strong>Saori Yuki</strong>\, “t
 he Barbra Streisand of Japan\,” in Japanese.</p>\n<p>With the <strong>Paci
 fic Youth Choir</strong> and the handbell choir <strong>Bells of the Casca
 des</strong>\, we recorded “Shchedryk\,” known in English-speaking countri
 es as “Carol of the Bells\,” with the original Ukrainian text which tells 
 of a lark flying into the house at the start of a new year\, thus bringing
  good fortune.</p>\n<p>We recorded a Hebrew prayer “Elohai N’tzor” with <s
 trong>Ida Rae Cahana</strong> and <strong>Ari Shapiro</strong> and <strong
 >Patricia Costa Kim</strong>. (Ida Rae Cahana was for many years the cante
 r at Central Synagogue in New York City and now lives in Portland.  Ari Sh
 apiro is the NPR White House correspondent\, and accordionist Patricia Cos
 ta Kim was just named director of education at Experience Music Project in
  Seattle\, but is also known by millions on YouTube as the keyboardist ban
 dleader of <strong>Sonseed</strong> and their Christian ska song “Jesus is
  a friend of mine”).</p>\n<p>There’s a Chinese New Year song from 1946\, a
  Felainspired version of “We Three Kings\,” a song in Ladino (the intersec
 tion of Spanish and Hebrew)\, “Silent Night” in the original German\, as w
 ell as a verse in Arabic and another in English.</p>\n<p>The album ends wi
 th a samba parade of “Auld Lang Syne” with choruses in English\, Arabic an
 d French over the incredible percussion of the <strong>Lions of Batucada</
 strong>.” Lauderdale notes\, “I love the holidays and all the music that g
 oes with it. We strove to make an inclusive and nondenominational album th
 at could be played anywhere in the world.”</p>\n<p><a href='http://pinkmar

 ovo. It was commissioned by the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds\, England

  of peace.”  It is a moving\, uplifting and inspirational work and “a rema

 “It’s exciting and comforting\, mournful and joyful\, reflecting every nua

 e power of the piece\, and is anxious for the orchestra to join us to feel
  the full emotional and musical impact. We feel that we’re starting locall

 cating for peace? Join the Sierra Master Chorale (SMC) for its spring conc
 erts featuring Karl Jenkins’ powerful work for choir and orchestra.  Karl 
 Jenkins’  “The <span class='il'>Armed</span> <span class='il'>Man</span>: 
 A Mass for Peace” was composed in 1999 and dedicated to the victims of Kos
 ovo. It was commissioned by the Royal Armouries Museum in Leeds\, England 
 to reflect the most war‐torn and destructive century in human history\, ho
 nor the warrior\, and inspire the optimism of “ringing in a thousand years
  of peace.”  It is a moving\, uplifting and inspirational work and “a rema
 rkable musical experience\,” as noted in the Sacramento Choral Calendar re
 view.</div>\n</p>\n<div>           The work seeks to bridge the many persp
 ectives of war while acknowledging the hope in every human heart for peace
  in our lifetime.</div>\n<div>\n<div class='gmail_quote'></div>\n<div clas
 s='gmail_quote'>          “The <span class='il'>Armed</span> <span class='
 il'>Man</span> is an emotionally stirring major work that takes us through
  the horrors of war and brings us to the hope that together we can ‘ring i
 n peace’\,” says InConcert’s board president and chorister Keith Porter.  
 “It’s exciting and comforting\, mournful and joyful\, reflecting every nua
 nce of emotion. From our first rehearsal\, the choir has been in awe of th
 e power of the piece\, and is anxious for the orchestra to join us to feel
  the full emotional and musical impact. We feel that we’re starting locall
 y to help build a healing vision of a future that will satisfy the yearnin
 g of every human heart.”</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>          Sierra
  Master Chorale members are overjoyed to be performing this work once agai
 n.  “The <span class='il'>Armed</span> <span class='il'>Man</span> was one
  of the most amazing experiences I’ve ever had\,” said soprano Vicki Cambr
 on\, “we were so well-prepared and Ken conducted us and the orchestra impe
 ccably\, it was just magical.”  The seventy-voice chorus is establishing a
  reputation of providing “not only beautiful music\, but a thrilling perfo
 rmance” to very enthusiastic audiences.</div>\n<div><strong>Fro</strong><s
 trong>m Vicki Cambron\, soprano:</strong></div>\n<blockquote><p>The Armed 
 Man was one of the most amazing experiences I’ve ever had. I am so very gr
 ateful to Ken for giving us this opportunity & to the orchestra & chorus f
 or their outstanding performances. Last\, but definitely not least -­‐ I’m
  very grateful to the audiences for taking this wonderful journey with all
  of us. Thursday night was especially magical. I don’t think in my wildest
  dreams I ever thought I’d be part of something like that. I can’t even be
 gin to describe what a wonderful experience it was. However\, I think I no
 w understand what some of the super stars experience on stage.   I’m still
  smiling & thinking about it still brings tears to my eyes & joy to my hea
 rt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>Some stand-out kudos belo

 l the wonderful members who presented “The <span class='il'>Armed</span> <
 span class='il'>Man</span>\; A mass for peace!!!  What an incredibly wonde
 rful piece of work and performed majestically!  Thank you for all your har
