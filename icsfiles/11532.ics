 /p>\n<p>6. Remember to put these Scriptures into LAW through confessing th
 em. The Word does not return you to void when the void is filled with Fait
 h.</p>\n<p><strong>How To Fast Effectively<br />\n</strong>•</p>\n<p>What 
 is fasting?<br />\nFasting is the free-will abstinence of foods for the pu
 rpose of seeking Gods presence and deepening one’s relationship with Him.<
 br />\nJoel 2:12 “Therefore also now\, says the Lord\, turn and keep on co
 ming to Me with all your heart\, with fasting\, with weeping\, and with mo
 urning [until every hindrance is removed and the broken fellowship is rest
 ored].<br />\n• What different types of fasting can we practice?<br />\n1.
  Partial fast:<br />\na. Partial in time or food<br />\nb. One meal a day<
 br />\nc. Sweets<br />\nd. Meats<br />\n2. Total fasting:<br />\na. Total 
 and complete elimination of food for a specific period of time (over 24 ho
 urs). Only water.</p>\n<p>When should we fast?<br />\nWe should fast at al
 l times\; Jesus said when you fast\, He never said if you fast.</p>\n<p>Ma
 tthew 6:16 “And whenever you are fasting\, do not look gloomy and sour and
  dreary like the hypocrites\, for they put on a dismal countenance\, that 
 their fasting may be apparent to and seen by men. Truly I say to you\, the
 y have their reward in full already.”</p>\n<p>Fasting should be a lifestyl
 e. One day\, a week\, two days or three\, seven or twenty-one days at a ti
 me.</p>\n<p>What to do when fasting?<br />\n1. Pray\, study the word\, med
 itate on life\, most importantly spend time with The Lord<br />\n2. Put a 
 temporary hold on invitations\, social settings\, and hearing “people prob
 lems”.<br />\n3. No T.V.<br />\n4. Prepare your body before and after the 
 fast. Decrease food consumption a couple of days before and after.<br />\n
 • Do not stop fasting because of symptoms or physical aches and pains that
  might arise.<br />\nDue to the elimination of accumulated toxins and fat\
 , the body will likely react with headaches\, body aches\, vomiting\, bad 
 breath\, poor sense of humor and more. This is a sign that the body is cle
 ansing itself.<br />\nKeep going even if you feel pain!<br />\nAsk the Hol
 y Spirit to help you endure.<br />\nThese symptoms will only last one to t
 hree days at most.</p>\n<p>• Don’t worry\, fasting does not cause death.<b
 r />\nThe average human body has sufficient reserves of energy to survive 
 40 days on water.<br />\nPresent your body as a living sacrifice to God.</
 p>\n<p>• What can we do when the body refuses to surrender?<br />\nExercis
 e restraint\, self-control\, and discipline when placing the body under su
 bmission.<br />\nChristian living is not a relay race but a long distance 
 race of faith and endurance\, to finish it\, the body must be weightless.<
 /p>\n<p>Hebrews 12:1 “Therefore then\, since we are surrounded by so great
  a cloud of witnesses [who have borne testimony to the Truth]\, let us str
 ip off and throw aside every encumbrance (unnecessary weight) and that sin
  which so readily (deftly and cleverly) clings to and entangles us\, and l
 et us run with patient endurance and steady and active persistence the app
 ointed course of the race that is set before us.”</p>\n<p>1 Corinthians 9:
 25-27 “Now every athlete who goes into training conducts himself temperate
 ly and restricts himself in all things. They do it to win a wreath that wi
 ll soon wither\, but we [do it to receive a crown of eternal blessedness] 
 that cannot wither. Therefore I do not run uncertainty (without definite a
 im). I do not box like one beating the air and striking without an adversa
 ry. But [like a boxer] I buffet my body [handle it roughly\, discipline it
  by hardships] and subdue it\, for fear that after proclaiming to others t
 he Gospel and things pertaining to it\, I myself should become unfit [not 
 stand the test\, be unapproved and rejected as a counterfeit].”</p>\n<p>Ro
 mans 12:1 “I appeal to you therefore\, brethren\, and beg of you in view o
 f [all] the mercies of God\, to make a decisive dedication of your bodies 
 [presenting all your members and faculties] as a living sacrifice\, holy (
 devoted\, consecrated) and well pleasing to God\, which is your reasonable
  (rational\, intelligent) service and spiritual worship.”</p>\n<p>• <stron
 g>The benefits and rewards of fasting.<br />\n</strong>o<br />\nWhat spiri
 tual and rewarding benefits are promised by God when we fast?<br />\n1. Fa
 sting destroys the spirit of delay.</p>\n<p>Daniel 10:1-3 “In the third ye
 ar of Cyrus king of Persia a word was revealed to Daniel\, who was called 
 Belteshazzar. And the word was true and it referred to great tribulation (
 conflict and wretchedness). And he understood the word and had understandi
 ng of the vision. In those days I\, Daniel\, was mourning for three whole 
 weeks. I ate no pleasant or desirable food nor did any meat or wine come i
 nto my mouth\; and I did not anoint myself at all for the full three weeks
 .</p>\n<p>What was Daniels conflict?</p>\n<p>Daniel 9:11-12 “Yes\, all Isr
 ael has transgressed Your law\, even turning aside that they might not obe
 y Your voice. Therefore the curse has been poured out on us and the oath t
 hat is written in the Law of Moses the servant of God\, because we have si
 nned against Him. And He has carried out intact His [threatening] words wh
 ich he threatened against is and against our judges [the kings\, princes\,
  and rulers generally] who ruled us a great evil\; for under the whole hea
 vens there has not been done before [anything so dreadful] as [He has caus
 ed to be] done against Jerusalem.”</p>\n<p>Who was the prince of Persia?</
 p>\n<p>A demonic principality that governs the airs in a region\, centerin
 g its efforts in delaying Gods answers to mans prayers.<br />\nToday\, thi
 s same spirit is causing the delay of many answers and blessings that God 
 wasn’t to give us.</p>\n<p>Daniel 10:13 “But the prince of the kingdom of 
 Persia withstood me for twenty-one days. Then Michael\, one of the chief [
 of the celestial] princes\, came to help me\, for I remained there with th
 e kings of Persia.”</p>\n<p>What was the result\, the reward\, of Daniel’s
  fast?</p>\n<p>He obtained the victory. The chief prince helped him overco
 me and remove the obstacle.<br />\nHe humbled himself and sought Gods face
 \, then the blessing was loosened.<br />\nDelay means to fast and pray!</p
 >\n<p>2. Fasting removes every mountain that stands in the way.</p>\n<p>Mo
 untain is a figure of speech that represents obstacles we face.<br />\nSom
 etimes these obstacles are placed by the enemy\; other times\, by the bad 
 decisions we make.<br />\nThe mountain comes against those who have won a 
 reputation in heaven.<br />\nThese mountains arise to try to stop those wh
 o are extending the kingdom with miracles\, healing\, and preaching the Go
 spel.<br />\nThe mountains come against those whose sole business is the k
 ingdom\, because everything they do is for the purpose of extending it on 
 earth.</p>\n<p>Luke 10:17-20 “The seventy returned with joy\, saying\, Lor
 d\, even the demons are subject to us in Your name! And He said to them\, 
 I saw Satan falling like lightning [flash] from heaven. Behold! I have giv
 en you authority and power to trample upon serpents and scorpions\, and [p
 hysical and mental strength and ability] over all the power that the enemy
  [possesses]\; and nothing shall in any way harm you. Nevertheless\, do no
 t rejoice at this\, that the spirits are subject to you\, but rejoice that
  your names are enrolled in heaven.”</p>\n<p>Jesus is basically saying the
  following: “If you continue to cast out demons\, healing the sick\, teach
 ing in “Houses of Peace”\, and using your business to advance the Kingdom\
 , you will develop a reputation in heaven and demons will know who you are
 .”</p>\n<p>Your name will be on “The Most Wanted List”<br />\nSought after
  by the troops of hell.<br />\nThe devil is not interested nor does he see
 k believers who have social clubs in their churches. Weak believers who ne
 ver cast out demons or heal the sick.<br />\nAre you a threat to the kingd
 om of darkness?<br />\nAre you using your business to extend the kingdom? 
 Are you using your gifts to extend the kingdom?<br />\nAre you saving soul
 s?</p>\n<p>Acts 19:15 “But [one] evil spirit retorted\, Jesus I know\, and
  Paul I know about\, but who are you?”</p>\n<p>Does the devil know who you
  are?</p>\n<p>Matthew 17:14-16 “And when they approached the multitude\, a
  man came up to Him\, kneeling before Him and saying\, Lord\, do pity and 
 have mercy on my son\, for he has epilepsy (is moonstruck) and he suffers 
 terribly\; for frequently he falls into the fire and many times into the w
 ater. And I brought him to Your disciples\, and they were not able to cure
  him”</p>\n<p>Have you noticed that everything was going well until you ma
 de god a promise concerning money? Everything was great.<br />\nYou were h
 ealing the sick\, delivering the captives etc. When suddenly\, everything 
 stopped. This happened because the enemy identified you as being dangerous
  and assigned a mountain\, a demonic principality to try and stop you.</p>
 \n<p>How do we defeat and remove that mountain?</p>\n<p>1. By faith.</p>\n
 <p>Matthew 17:20 “He said to them\, Because of the littleness of your fait
 h [that is\, your lack of firmly relying trust]. For truly I say to you\, 
 if you have faith [that is living] like a grain of mustard seed\, you can 
 say to this mountain\, Move from here to yonder place\, and it will move\;
  and nothing will be impossible to you.”<br />\n2. By fasting\, prayer\, a
 nd worship.<br />\n3. By speaking to the mountain.<br />\n3. Fasting break
 s demonic strongholds.</p>\n<p>Isaiah 58:6 “[Rather] is not this the fast 
 that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness\, to undo he bands of
  the yoke\, to let the oppressed go free\, and that you break ever [enslav
 ing] yoke?”</p>\n<p>Certain strongholds can only be broken by fasting\, su
 ch as<br />\n– Mental oppression<br />\n– Fear<br />\n– Depression<br />\n
 – Sexual deviations<br />\n– Gambling<br />\n– Addictions<br />\n– Doubt<b
 r />\n– Idolatry<br />\n– Debt</p>\n<p>4. Fasting prepares the climate for
  the spirit to guide and speak to us.<br />\nActs 13:1-3 “Now in the churc
 h (assembly) at Antioch there were prophets (inspired interpreters of the 
 will and purposes of God) and teachers: Barnabas\, Symeon who was called N
 iger [Black]\, Lucius of Cyrene\, Manaen a member of the court of Herod th
 e tetrarch\, and Saul. While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting\, t
 he Holy Spirit said\, Separate now for Me Barnabas and Saul for the work t
 o which I have called them. Then after fasting and praying\, they put thei
 r hands on them and sent them away.”<br />\nFasting increases our sensitiv
 ity to God’s voice. It enables us to hear His words with greater clarity a
 nd certainty.<br />\nFasting prepares the atmosphere when we need to make 
 important decisions.</p>\n<p>5. It loosens the power to overcome temptatio
 n.</p>\n<p>Matthew 4:1-2 “Then Jesus was led (guided) by the [Holy] Spirit
  into the wilderness (desert) to be tempted (tested and tried) by the devi
 l. And He went without food for forty days and forty nights\, and later He
  was hungry.”</p>\n<p>Often we pass through the dessert and are tempted to
  act independently</p>\n<p>6. Fasting loosens power for times of warfare.<
 /p>\n<p>2 Chronicles 20:1-3 “After this\, the Moabites\, the Ammonites\, a
 nd with them the Meunites came against Jehoshaphat to battle. It was told 
 Jehoshaphat\, A great multitude has come against you from beyond the [Dead
 ] Sea\, from Edom\; and behold they are in Hazazon-tamar\, which is En-ged
 i. Then Jehoshaphat feared\, and set himself [determinedly\, as his vital 
 need] to seek the Lord\; he proclaimed a fast in all Judah.”<br />\nWarfar
 e is time to declare fasting\, prayer\, and worship.<br />\nThen the war s
 hifts to Him and He is able to personally intervene.</p>\n<p>2 Chronicles 
 20:15 “He said\, Hearken\, all Judah\, you inhabitants of Jerusalem\, and 
 you King Jehoshaphat. The Lord says this to you: Be not afraid or dismayed
  at this great multitude\; for the battle is not yours\, but God’s.”</p>\n
 <p><strong>What was the outcome of the fasting?<br />\n</strong><br />\n2 
 Chronicles 20:22 “And when they began to sing and to praise\, the Lord set
  ambushments against the men of Ammon\, Moab\, and Mount Seir who had come
  against Judah\, and they were [self-] slaughtered\;”<br />\nIf the enemy 
 is attacking any area in your life\, declare a fast and allow God to fight
  for you.<br />\nSpeak to the mountain and loosen your blessings!</p>\n<p>
 • Fasting does the following:</p>\n<p>1. Breaks the power of the spirit of
  delay<br />\n2. Removes the mountain or principality that stands in our w
 ay.<br />\n3. Breaks the strongholds of wickedness.<br />\n4. Prepare the 
 atmosphere for the Holy Spirit to speak to us.<br />\n5. Loosens the power
  to overcome every temptation.<br />\n6. Loosens the power to prepare us f
 or war.<br />\n7. Loosens the impartation of His Glory.<br />\n8. Makes mi
 racles and healing to occur at a greater rates and instantaneously.<br />
 \n9. Gives us greater authority over demons.<br />\n10. Increases our abil
 ity to receive revelation of His word.</p>

  possess a passion for the Kingdom just as the man in Matthew 13:44 where 
 it states <em><strong>“Again\, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure
  hid in a field\; the which when a man hath found\, he hideth\, and for jo
 y thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath\, and buyeth that field.”</st
 rong></em> Jovan believes that anyone can experience temporary successful 
 in the world system but knows that real success only dwells in God’s syste
 m (The Kingdom). Born February 20\, 1978 in Detroit he has seen the good\,
  the bad\, and the ugly. Raised by loving parents and spending most of his
  time in the pentecostal church where emotions ran high but the true Spiri
 t of God did not. As a child Jovan would experience several tragedies incl
 uding sexual abuse in the church\, and witnessing severe hypocrisy in the 
 church. These events would later attempt to break him\, and cause him to f
 orever abort his purpose\, but God’s Love! At 17 years old Jovan felt a ca
 ll to ministry and was excepted by his late pastor of 20 years Lorris Upsh
 aw Sr. Full of zeal with no knowledge\, and not facing the real issues of 
 his childhood. Caused a severe identity crisis which spiraled into Seven y
 ears of an up and down relationship with God. During this time Jovan exper
 ienced everything\, from: divorce\, drugs\, alchohol\, local jails\, and e
 ven atheism. In 2004 Pastor Jovan’s deliverance began. In 2006 it was mani
 fested!God’s favor rapidly released on his life when he met the missing pi
 ece of his existence Jennifer Timmon. After only two and a half months of 
 knowing each other. Jovan made the best decision of his life and married J
 ennifer on New Years Eve 12/31/2006. From that day Jovan has seen the hand
  of God mightily on his behalf. From writing a books\, to writing and perf
 orming for Oprah Winfrey\, to Launching a Church in Savannah Georgia. Jova
 n and Jennifer share two covenant children Jerea and Josiah who are the ap
 ple of their eyes. Jovan also has Three outside children whom he loves dea
 rly Alexis\, Jovon\, and Ivyon. With greater things on the horizon Jovan i
 s dedicated to work the purpose and gifting bestowed upon him like never b
 efore.</p>
