DESCRIPTION:<p>Come dance all night at our African Salsa dance party. Start
 ing at 10pm and going until 4am with DJs after the bands.</p>\n<p>Raised i
 n The Democratic Republic of the Congo (known as Zaire at the time) with A
 ngolan family roots\, Ricardo Lemvo came to the U.S. in the 1980s\, where 
 he formed Makina Loca. The group’s “seamless\, organic and infectious” (Lo
 s Angeles Times) blend of Cuban and African rumba and soukous\, Angolan ki
 zomba and samba\, and Cuban son and salsa has garnered them critical accla
 im in the decades since. “Ricardo Lemvo blends Cuba\, Congo into one soulf
 ul package\,” wrote The Chicago Tribune\, calling him “one of the few arti
 sts in tropical music today who is moving the genre forward.” </p>\n<p>Ope
 ning the concert will be Isabel Novella\, a stunning new Afropolitan voice
  from Mozambique. Unique in style and performance\, Novella has carved her
  own niche as an artist who straddles soul-bossa jazz\, marrabenta-bossa\,
  and up beat Afro-soul to create a sound that Novella calls “pop-world sou
 l.”</p>\n<p>For more information: http://goo.gl/kdv0JH</p>\n<p>This concer
 t is a part of World Music Institute’s Lusophone Festival\, a cross-cultur

DESCRIPTION:<p>We are a FREE cosplay event based in NYC ♥<br />\nReady for 
 Round 2? Here it is!<br />\n***DATE IS STILL TENTATIVE. EITHER OCTOBER 16t
 h OR OCTOBER 23rd IF THE SEPTEMBER 27TH DATE IS A NO GO.</p>\n<p>I would a
 sk that if you can definitely make this date\, please rsvp YES instead of 
 maybe!<br />\nDue to the size and the location in Central Park which is a 
 mass populated public attraction we MUST abide by a set guideline of rules
 . This is not me doing this\, this is the staff of Central Park\, and I as
 k you please be respectful to what they have asked of me.</p>\n<p>——————–R
 ULES——————–</p>\n<p>1. No Weapons. (Fake or not\, please do not bring a pr
 op weapon. Props that are not weapon are okay. CP Special Events Staff are
  not allowing us to bring weapon like props. This includes but is not limi
 ted to: Swords\, Guns\, Scythes\, Blades\, Sabers\, Knives\, Kunais\, Shur
 ikans\, Bats\, Mallets\, Hammers\, Whips\, etc. IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT IT
  IS MADE OF. THIS RULE IS TO PROTECT THE BYSTANDERS AND OURSELVES SO THAT 
 IF SOMEONE ACCIDENTALLY MISTAKES THE PROP AS A REAL WEAPON WE DO NOT GET S
 HUT DOWN. The luxury of cons have staffs and security with an enclosed spa
 ce of people that understand what your prop is. This is outside in public 
 domain\, so we dont have that luxury. If you are unsure if you can bring y
 our prop\, message me. I will respond ASAP letting you know if it is okay 
 or not.</p>\n<p>2. Family Appropriate Costumes. Please no excessive nudity
  or things that would not be family appropriate. There will be children in
  the park as well as older people.</p>\n<p>3. Nothing Scary. Nothing extre
 mely bloody and gory. (Look I know we all go to conventions and we are use
 d to seeing blood dripping from peoples mouths and zombies\, and all that 
 jazz but the normal person is not\, especially young children. I would ask
  that if you have a choice\, wear the costume you think would be better. I
  tried to counteract this\, but hey\, we are going to their park and using
  their space\, so we need to use their rules.</p>\n<p>Thank you always for
  your cooperation and interest in my event. And as always\, feel free to m
 essage me with any personal questions\, comments or suggestions. Thank you
