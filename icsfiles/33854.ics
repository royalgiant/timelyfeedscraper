DESCRIPTION:<p>In the age of small digital cameras and smart phones\, the u
 se of the large\, somewhat cumbersome\, view cameras would seem anachronis
 tic.  As opposed to those made with a handheld 35mm or digital camera\, la
 rge-format camera images are not composed by looking through a viewfinder 
 or referencing a digital screen. Instead\, the photographer stands beneath
  a dark focusing cloth to view the scene in front of the lens as an image 
 on a piece of ground glass. This image makes the subject appear upside-dow
 n and backwards\, which emphasizes the abstract formal properties of the c
 omposition and encourages close attention to subject matter during the con
 ception of the image. </p>\n<p>Opening Reception October 8 at 5:30</p>
