 n JST’s Tenacious” – Since its inception in 1978\, the Jubilee Sailing Tru
 st has strived to enable people of all physical abilities to sail. This is
  Derek’s story of his trip across the Atlantic.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<
 p>The Jubilee Sailing Trust is a registered charity and was set up with th
 e aim of promoting the integration of people of all physical abilities thr
 ough the challenge and adventure of sailing tall ships on the open sea. Th
 e Jubilee Sailing Trust has been changing lives since 1978. In that year i
 t became a registered charity through the extraordinary vision of a dedica
 ted group of people working against the odds to make their dream a reality
 . Back then the idea of integrating physically disabled with able-bodied p
 eople on a tall ship was a unique concept\, and yet the JST still remains 
 to this day the only organisation of its kind in the world.</p>\n<p>The JS
 T’s two ships\, Lord Nelson and Tenacious\, have sailed many hundreds of t
 housands of miles and have helped change thousands of lives\, operating in
  European and North Atlantic waters. Both ships are regular visitors to Fr
 ance and Ireland in the summer and the Canaries or Mediterranean in the wi
 nter. Tenacious has spent many of her winters in the Caribbean (with numer
 ous Atlantic crossings)\, since she was launched. Tenacious took part in t
 he Queen’s Diamond Jubilee Pageant\, a fitting follow up to the charity ha
 ving being named after the Queen’s Silver Jubilee Fund.</p>\n<p>This is De
 rek Trendell’s story of his crossing of the Atlantic from Bermuda to South
 ampton on the Jubilee Sailing Trust’s square rigger “Tenacious”.</p>

 ked are about his ‘favourites’! What are the pictures you are most pleased
  with – what is the best place you have visited – which subjects do you mo
 st enjoy photographing? These are impossible questions to answer because o
 nes opinion constantly changes. How can you possibly compare the Queenslan
 d tropical rain forest with the desert of Utah\; or compare the delicate b
 ut vibrant sunbirds with the power and majesty of a bald eagle? It may be 
 impossible but\, in this lecture\, he is going to try! Working his way thr

 – Abandoned buildings are her passion\,  as are the details of places that
  attract her eye\, the minutiae that collects in hidden corners\, the smal
 l parts of bigger things that are fascinating in their own right.</p>\n<p>
 Viveca Koh is a self-taught Fine Art photographer\, with a special fascina
 tion for small details\, for lost\, abandoned\, poignant and generally bro
 ken objects\, and also for darkness contrasting with light\, both in a phy
 sical and emotional sense.</p>\n<p>Many of her illustrative images simply 
 evolve as she is working on them – starting off with a quite straightforwa
 rd idea of what she wants to achieve but is always willing to venture wher
 ever the photograph wants her to go\, as she overlays multiple images toge
 ther or add textures\, scanned documents as new layers\, and subtle shadin
 g. Two photographs may blend together in a way that she could not have pre
 viously imagined\, and this is one of the things that Viveca finds so exci
 ting and all-consuming in her work\, to produce a final image that perhaps
  a little bit different\, that invokes emotion in the viewer and makes the
 m question their sense of the world as they know it.</p>\n<p>In June 2014 
 she was awarded a Fellowship Distinction by the Royal Photographic Society
 \, following on from an Associateship Distinction in June 2011 and a Licen
 tiateship Distinction in 2010.</p>

 including a demonstration of painting with light.</p>\n<p>On this evening 
 we will be treated to a show of superb artistic talent by Diana Goss\, MSc
  UKCP ARPS who specialises in\, and thoroughly enjoys\, Night Photography.
  Diana will be giving us her history of shooting in the darkness with a co
 uple of audiovisuals and a selection of DPIs. During the first half she wi
 ll explain the technical aspects of shooting in the dark\, and after the b
 reak\, the creative aspects. Her friend and colleague Elmer Maniebo will b
 e coming with her and giving us some light painting demos during the talk.
 </p>\n<p>Diana has led a very interesting life being a qualified Consultan
 t Psychotherapist and also being involved with the retail motor trade with
  a partner importing exotic models\, not to mention raising two children.<
 /p>\n<p>Diana will explain some of the techniques she uses to obtain some 
 of her images which involves ‘stacking’ a great many different frames\; us
 ing torches and other light sources to ‘paint objects with light’ during l
 ong exposures and using illuminated wires to produce coloured lines in spe
 cific places within the images.</p>\n<p>Diana possesses the most amazing a
 rtistic talent to bring together all the different facets of her images fo
 rming a finished masterpiece. She has had many acceptances by different Sa
 lons and was recently awarded her ARPS with a panel of prints which will b
 e on display.</p>
