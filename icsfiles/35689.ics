 SD Symposium will address the latest research on EOS and ESD protection in
  the rapidly changing world of electronics. With the emergence on the inte
 rnet of things on the horizon\, systems must become ever more reliable. Dr
 iving costs down so that electronics become even more pervasive requires h
 igh-yield manufacturing and assembly\, with low tolerance for excursions. 
 The technology to make all of this happen continues to evolve. FinFETs are
  becoming common place. 3D and 2.5D integration is reaching manufacturing 
 maturity. Performance prediction through simulation and verification check
 s must continue to advance to a greater degree of thoroughness and accurac
 y. The 2015 EOS/ESD Symposium addresses these matters and more through tut
 orials\, workshops\, technical sessions\, and invited talks.</p>

 >This two-day seminar and workshop is intended to introduce HALT & HASS to
  those who want to learn enough about the methods to perform them very wel
 l\, with no additional assistance. It is also intended to prevent practiti
 oners from   committing the most frequently made mistakes. Many use the wo
 rds but not the correct techniques. Learn how to do it correctly. One and 
 a half day classroom and half day hands on workshop.</p>\n<p>The seminar f
 ocuses on the value of HALT and HASS throughout the design and manufacturi
 ng processes. Participants will obtain a better understanding of what the 
 HALT and HASS methods do for process and product maturity in an organizati
 on and will enable better integration of the methods of HALT and HASS into
  the design and manufacturing processes respectively.   The author shares 
 his own experiences with rapid product maturity through deployment of disc
 iplines such as Design for Six Sigma\, Lean Engineering\, Design for Manuf
 acturability and Reliability engineering and how HALT and HASS can be used
  to enhance these design disciplines. If your company is using a phase rev
 iew program management process during development and has adopted an ISO q
 uality management system\, the seminar will explore how the HALT and HASS 
 techniques significantly enhance these programs. These discussions are int
 erwoven throughout the seminar.</p>\n<p>HALT and HASS are presented as par
 t of a holistic program of reliability validation. The instructor sets a f
 oundation of what HALT does and how it works by reviewing key concepts of 
 the big picture of environmental<br />\ntesting. Mil-Spec 810.G is reviewe
 d in the context of what the military expects a supplier to do in order to
  assure product reliability. Conventional methods of environmental testing
  are long and laborious\; they require many sample devices to make it thro
 ugh the test process. Learn why the samples and time are dramatically redu
 ced by using HALT during the design process. Learn why reliability growth 
 testing (RGT) can be eliminated by using more effective HASS methods durin
 g manufacturing.</p>\n<p>In addition\, this seminar goes into real-world f
 ailure mechanisms and how environmental dynamics such as temperature and v
 ibration inter-act with parts and materials in the design. This includes e
 ffects on electronic components and circuits as well as electro-mechanical
  devices and optical alignments.</p>\n<p>The leaders in the application of
  the methods learned from these seminars\, which have been presented since
  1980 in an ever evolving and improving form. The seminar follows the text
  HALT & HASS\, Accelerated Reliability Engineering by Gregg K. Hobbs\, the
  inventor of the methods. This is the original and most complete book on t
 he subject.</p>

 </p>\n<p>D560 is a five-day course that expands upon and replaces our popu
 lar three-day RS 560. It provides both a complete DFR framework and a step
 -by-step application of the framework. The course provides a complete DFR 
 plan that can be customized to meet specific needs. It also teaches how to
  apply each step in the process through an extensive hands-on portion that
  uses a simulated team development environment\, with the students taking 
 on different roles during the product development process.</p>\n<p>D560 pr
 esents concepts and software that you could use to help your organization:
 <br />\n– Gain an understanding of the methods\, terms and metrics used in
  reliability\, when to apply particular tools during the product developme
 nt life cycle and the associated benefits and drawbacks of each.<br />\n– 
 Implement a holistic DFR process in product/system design environments and
  leverage the benefits of this process\, namely the Faster\, Better\, Chea
 per values that drive the Reliability 3.0 process.<br />\n– Build an effec
 tive reliability culture within the organization and help to determine wha
 t needs to be added or improved in your DFR initiatives.<br />\n– Evaluate
  your strengths in each methodology\, which will serve as a guide for any 
 additional skills you may need to acquire or augment.</p>

 mposiumOnTinWhiskers.htm</p>\n<p>Since its inception\, the International S
 ymposium on Tin Whiskers has been the most prominent forum for discussing 
 the current state of knowledge related to tin whiskers. Tin whiskers\, whi
 ch are electrically conductive tin filaments that grow spontaneously from 
 tin-finished surfaces\, remain a known failure risk in electronics that ha
 ve tin-finished surfaces. Despite significant research over the past decad
 e\, the ability to predict whisker growth for long-life applications remai
 ns a challenge. Further\, studies on the use of barriers\, such as conform
 al coating\, to contain whiskers and prevent whisker contact have demonstr
 ated issues with insufficient coverage and whiskers erupting from beneath 
 thin coverage. Past presentations at this symposium have examined growth t
 heories\, whisker failures\, and risk assessment and mitigations strategie

 not an in-depth electrical engineering course but rather is aimed at indiv
 iduals who require an intensive overview of basic principals\, potential p
 itfalls and practical techniques\, without the assumption of much prior kn
 owledge of the topic.<br />\nThe course is fast paced and as non-mathemati
 cal as possible. It begins with a review of electrostatic concepts\, such 
 as charges\, fields and forces. It then takes up the basic theory of elect
 rostatic and electromagnetic fields and field coupling. Armed with an unde
 rstanding of the problem-causing mechanisms\, students are prepared to dev
 ise solutions. The course addresses practical considerations such as cabli
 ng choices and the proper design and use of grounds. Effective grounding a
 nd shielding of amplifiers\, voltmeters and enclosures will be covered. Te
 chniques for measuring shielding effectiveness will be addressed. Electros
 tatic Discharge (ESD) will be covered as it relates to equipment design. C
 omprehensive units on circuit board layout and switching power supplies co
 nclude the course.</p>

 0111SEMINAR/statistical-sampling-plans?channel=mailer&camp=webinar&AdGroup
 =DAN_OLEARY_APR30_NOV17_PARTA</p>\n<p>Many companies use acceptance sampli
 ng as a standard business practice. The most common applications use attri
 bute sampling based on ANSI/ASQ Z1.4 and Zero Acceptance Number Sampling P
 lans by Nicholas L. Squeglia. These common methods are not always the best
  approaches. This seminar will expose to you to a variety of methods and h
 elp you understand when to use them.</p>\n<p>While many of the examples co
 me from medical device manufacturing because of the rigid regulatory struc
 ture\, the methods apply in aviation\, defense\, and other manufacturing s
 ettings.</p>\n<p>This unique hands-on course provides attendees with a sol
 id understanding of acceptance sampling methods and their application to m
 anufacturing. The course delivers tools\, templates\, and insight that wil
 l allow participants to choose and implement the best sampling methods for
  their application.</p>\n<p>Many companies have procedures and programs th
 at fall short of the regulatory requirements and good statistical practice
 . In some cases\, FDA may give the firm a 483 or even a Warning Letter. QM
 S audits may result in nonconformances that need to be addressed. In other
  cases\, the firm may not use the best methods\, resulting in waste of res
 ources.</p>\n<p>This two-day hands-on course provides a clear understandin
 g\, with many exercises\, of the methods and underlying statistics for acc
 eptance sampling. As part of the practical implementation\, the course exp
 lains common standards such as Z1.4 for attribute sampling and Z1.9 for va
 riables sampling. In addition\, the course covers other\, less well know\,
  methods such as sequential sampling\, continuous sampling\, and chain sam
 pling.</p>\n<p>The course also covers specific applications of sampling in
 cluding incoming inspection\, design validation\, design verification\, pr
 ocess validation\, and quality audits.</p>\n<p>Who will benefit:<br />\nQu

 urse-nov-17-19-2015-atlanta-ga/</p>\n<p>This course provides a comprehensi
 ve introduction to RCM2 and its principles. It is intended for those who a
 re interested in understanding what RCM2 is and how it can be applied to d
 efi ne technically based maintenance and reliability programs. The applica
 tion of RCM2 challenges the traditional approach to equipment maintenance 
 by moving you from a breakdown and repair mentality to a culture of asset 
 management. Not only does it revolutionize views about maintenance but als
 o about how maintenance\, operations and engineering should work together 
 to drive asset performance. RCM2 leads to a far broader and deeper underst
 anding of the organization’s assets and provides a structured way to forma
 lly capture and transfer that knowledge to the rest of the asset stakehold
 ers. This introduction to RCM2 redefi nes your understanding of maintenanc
 e management and will completely transform the way that maintenance and op
 erations people view the development of maintenance programs and their rol
 es and responsibilities in that process. This course applies best practice
 s in answering the seven questions of RCM2 using a real life\, case study 
 approach. The participants will explore the techniques required to defi ne
  a maintenance program in a logical and structured way that recognizes the
  hidden\, safety\, environmental and operating consequences of failure.</p

 tes:<br />\n– None<br />\nAssumes Basic Knowledge Of:<br />\n– Undergradua
 te Algebra<br />\n– Elementary Calculus<br />\n– Probability and Statistic
 s</p>\n<p>The immensely popular G400 course sets the foundation for all su
 bsequent seminars by introducing and familiarizing the attendee to the fun
 damental concepts in reliability engineering mathematics\, from basic data
  analysis and modeling to advanced methods and concepts. It begins with an
  in-depth discussion of the fundamentals of Weibull and Life Data Analysis
  and continues by expanding the learned concepts to more advanced subjects
 .  </p>\n<p>G400 presents concepts and software that will help you to:<br 
 />\n– Understand how life data analysis methodologies can be applied when 
 you need to understand and communicate how a product will perform over tim
 e\, such as:<br />\n     – Setting meaningful reliability targets\, demons
 trating whether an item meets the specification and/or effectively communi
 cating performance estimates to management.<br />\n     – Identifying whet
 her an item will experience infant mortality and/or wearout and making pre
 dictions about performance during the useful life (or warranty) period.<br
  />\n     – Evaluating suppliers and/or comparing designs based on reliabi
 lity.<br />\n– Become familiar with the applications of other essential re
 liability data analysis methods\, such as ALT\, RBDs and RGA.</p>

 2</p>\n<p>The state-of-the-art power switching devices made from SiC and G
 aN semiconductors contain a high density of crystal defects. Most of these
  defects are present in starting wafers and some are generated during devi
 ce processing. There is little conclusive evidence so far on the exact rol
 e that the crystal defects play on device performance\, manufacturing yiel
 d\, and more importantly\, long-term field-reliability especially when dev
 ices are operating under extreme stressful environments. This webinar will
  provide a review of the current state-of-the-art of SiC and GaN power sem
 iconductor material technology\, and the potential impact crystal defects 
 may have on high-density power switching electronics. A review of silicon 
 technology development and manufacturing evolution is made to draw a paral
 lel between silicon and wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductor power electronics
 . Finally\, the bottlenecks which must be overcome in order to achieve hig
 h reliability power switching device technologies will be discussed.</p>

 ebonds made today in commercial products are made with copper wire. Like n
 o lead solders this emerging mainstream technology is finding its way into
  high reliability microcircuits for military\, space\, automotive and medi
 cal devices. Conversion from Gold (Au) wire to Copper (Cu) wire are mainly
  cost driven. Gold (Au) prices (per ounce) increased dramatically while (C
 u) prices (per pound) remain the same. The stiffer copper wire and higher 
 thermal conductivity have also increased the design flexibility. The quest
 ion now becomes how reliable are these wirebond interconnects and are the 
 existing process controls\, screening and qualification tests sufficient t
 o detect and eliminate early field failures. This webinar reviews these co

 nar/</p>\n<p>$199</p>\n<p>It’s always amazing to see how many completed co
 rrective action requests list “human error” as the root cause and “retrain
 ing” as the solution. The problem is that this is almost never effective\,
  but organizations continue to do it over and over (and\, of course\, get 
 the same results … no change in performance).</p>\n<p>Human error is simpl
 y a category of causes\, and if we want to prevent them we need to find ou
 t why the individual made the error. Only then can we apply a solution tha
 t will be effective. There are many typologies used for diagnosing human e
 rror\, each often utilized in specific types of problem situations.</p>\n<
 p>This one-hour webinar will explain why human error should not be the sto
 pping point\, but instead simply a new problem definition that will then b
 e explored deeper in order to find the actual cause. It will provide multi
 ple approaches for determining whether the human error was caused by the i
 ndividual or the environment in which he or she was working.</p>\n<p>Duke

 In the age of the Internet of Things\, traditional methods become ineffect
 ive or inadequate. New data requirements and regulatory mandates force us 
 into a deeper dive into strategic analysis. This presentation takes a clos
 er look at what maintenance professionals will see\, and what will be expe
 cted of them in this new age. The presentation will discuss how future ass
 ets should behave\, which tools are available now\, and what should be exp
 ected from maintenance professionals moving forward.</p>\n<p>Learning obje
 ctives:</p>\n<p>1. How will the Internet of Things affect maintenance prac
 tices?<br />\n2. How will more strategic analysis of data affect maintenan
 ce strategies?<br />\n3. What new skills will current maintenance professi
 onals have to acquire?</p>\n<p>Presenter: Dave Reiber\, CMRP\, Business So

 31859234</p>\n<p>Fred Schenkelberg</p>\n<p>The best time to estimate the r
 eliability of a design is after all units have shipped and failed. Thus we
  know when and why the units failed. This allows us to create an estimate 
 that is fairly accurate. In practice we do not have this luxury\, thus rel
 y on a range of tools to create reliability predictions.</p>\n<p>Let’s sta
 rt with the notion that parts count predictions are pretty much fiction. T
 hey do not provide a meaningful estimate of field performance. Using an in
 dustry database to find and tally failure rates is a futile exercise. </p>
 \n<p>Engineering judgement\, field data\, vendor experimental evidence\, p
 hysics of failure models\, and accelerated life testing provide a range of
  tools that we can use to create an estimate that has value. Sure\, these 
 approaches may take more work than a quick parts count prediction\, yet pr
 ovide meaningful results.</p>\n<p>Over the course of a project we may have
  the large uncertainty of only engineering judgement. Later we refine the 
 estimates using improved models and analysis. The intent is to provide fee
 dback to the team in an ongoing manner to enable the team to meet or excee
 d the reliability requirements.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about what works and ho
 w to find the information you need to make reliability predictions. Plus\,
  we’ll bash Mil Hdbk 217 a little\, too. Providing estimates that forecast
  field reliability performance is our goal.</p>

 6</p>\n<p>Presented by Dr. Alec Feinberg</p>\n<p>This 3.5-hour course\, wh
 ich costs $350\, will start with the basics\, defining such terms as “G”\,
  “g”\, “GRMS” and “G-Force”. We will explain the physics of shock and vibr
 ation in understandable terms. At the end of this course the student will 
 be able to clearly understand shock and vibration\, its terms\, how tests 
 are specified\, and have the capability to apply software as a test aid. T
 his course provides excel based software to aid the student in quickly lea
 rning shock and vibration fundamentals. With the DfRSoft Shock and Vibrati
 on Software\, the student will be able to specify shock tests and perform 
 a number of analyses. Every section below will have many examples to aid t
 he student.</p>\n<p>Shock Test and Analysis</p>\n<p>The course will overvi
 ew the different types of mechanical shock and test methods\, including dr
 op shock and electro-dynamic shock pulse and Shock Response Spectrum (SRS)
  testing (and how these tests are specified). The software will help the u
 ser specify drop height\, Gs\, pulse durations and the need to calibrate t
 he equipment.</p>\n<p>Constant Acceleration</p>\n<p>We will overview const
 ant acceleration physics and testing. The student will understand the basi
 cs terms (RPN\, Gs\, and equipment radius) and how to specify this test an
 d what key elements are needed to perform a successful constant accelerati
 on test.</p>\n<p>Sine Vibration</p>\n<p>Sine vibration fundamental and phy
 sics will be explained in understandable terms\, including natural and for
 cing frequency\, damping\, Q\, and resonances. We will detail a vibration 
 test system’s set up. The student will be able to use the software to unde
 rstand vibration testing and the interrelationships between sine amplitude
 \, frequency\, velocity and acceleration. We will discuss circuit board an
 d equipment sine search resonance track and dwell testing\, definition of 
 an octave\, sweep rate\, graphical sine estimation of Q from the data and 
 how to estimate if the resonance is too large and requires damping. How be
 st to track a resonance using the phase shift method during a resonance sc
 an. The software will help the student understand the proper octave sweep 
 rate for resonance searching and key locations to place an accelerometer. 
 We will introduce S-N fatigue curves and the use of Minor’s rule. A discus
 sion on time compression will follow for the vibration acceleration model 
 and how to use it for fatigue life testing. Numerous examples\, problems a
 nd solutions are provided.</p>\n<p>Random Vibration</p>\n<p>Here we will i
 ntroduce why we do random vibration\, how to understand the frequency doma
 in and the test specification\, including common tests that are specified.
  The student will be able to estimate from the G2/Hz Power Spectral Densit
 y (PSD)\, the G-level content for both simple and complex spectra. An over
 view of basic random as well as sine on random\, random on random\, tri-ax
 ial and angular vibration testing (along with angular fixture use) will be
  discussed. How to use random vibration to estimate Qs observed in the PSD
  spectra will be explained. As well\, the random vibration acceleration mo
 del for time compression will be exemplified using the software and how it
  differs for sine vibration and its use for fatigue life estimation in X\,
  Y\, and Z directions. Accelerometer use will be overviewed for random vib
 ration. Repetitive shock will be overviewed which is used in HALT testing 
 and how this spectrum differs from random vibration. What are the strength
 s and weakness of repetitive shock? When to use HALT versus electro-dynami
 c (ED) random vibration testing?</p>

 knot.” Different people from different departments each know part of the p
 roblem. The facilitator collects and organizes all of the details in an in
 cident. He or she essentially untangles the knot to provide complete expla
 nation of what happened and why. An effective facilitator provides clarity
 . Sometimes people think of a facilitator as the person who leads meetings
 \, but a root cause analysis facilitator manages the entire investigation 
 process. It starts from the time an incident occurs and continues through 
 the analysis and documentation\, to the implementation of solutions and th

 </p>\n<p>One of the cornerstones of ThinkReliability’s approach is that we
  don’t use complicated\, expensive software to build Cause Maps – we use M
 icrosoft Excel. The drawing tools within Excel are intuitive\, flexible an
 d can quickly create a detailed Cause Map. All the documentation for an in
 cident fits within one Excel file\, which can be viewed by anyone who has 
 Excel. In this Webinar\, we’ll teach you how to create timelines and graph
 s to aid in the understanding of your incidents using only tools available
  in Excel.</p>

 6</p>\n<p>The original Tacoma Narrows Bridge was nicknamed “Galloping Gert
 ie” because it experienced large up and down movement on windy days. On No
 vember 7\, 1940\, the bridge’s up and down movement changed to a never bef
 ore seen twisting mode\, which increased until the cables snapped and the 
 bridge was destroyed a little more than four months after it opened. Join

 31906360</p>\n<p>Fred Schenkelberg</p>\n<p>Lets explore MTBF in two parts.
  First let’s share some stories about how the use of MTBF leads to mis-und
 erstandings and poor decisions. How bad can the use of MTBF really be? Wha
 t have you seen and how much time have you spent educating others about MT
 BF?</p>\n<p>Second\, let me propose that we simply use reliability as a re
 placement metric. The probability of success over  duration. Right form th
 e definition for reliability. It straight forward\, the math is easy\, and
  very few can misinterpret it’s meaning. For a bonus ass the cost per fail
 ure to tie the reliability metrics into business objectives language (mone
 y).</p>\n<p>Finally\, what to do if you’re organization or vendors are mir
 ed in the use of MTBF.  Let’s discuss the next steps and what you can do t
 oday to minimizes the adverse impact of MTBF. Plus\, let’s share some succ
 ess stores of steps various organizations are taking to improve their reli
 ability programs simply by avoiding the use of MTBF.</p>\n<p>If you face e
 ntrenched positions supporting the use of MTBF\, and you want to change to
  a better measure\, this webinar is for you. If you have moved your organi
 zation away from MTBF\, please join the conversation and share how you did
  it.</p>

 8</p>\n<p>Conductive Anodic Filamentation (CAF) is a subsurface failure mo
 de for woven glass-reinforced laminate (FR4) materials\, in which a copper
  salt filament grows and results in a consequential electrical short betwe
 en plated through-hole (PTH) walls or adjacent copper planes. In this webi
 nar we cover FR4 laminates\, in the form of high PTH density multi-layer t
 est circuits\, exposed to different manufacturing conditions and studied f
 or resistance to CAF initiation and growth. CAF performance was assessed u
 sing high temperature and humidity conditions to promote failures\, with a
  voltage applied across adjacent vias. By application of a range of voltag
 es and via geometries the basis for a performance map for laminates was ob
 tained for use in materials comparison. The changes due to exposure of lam
 inates to lead-free temperatures and other processing steps were then exam
 ined using the technique\, and a number of important recommendations made 
 regarding minimising the possibility of CAF initiation and growth. A new a
 pproach to characterise CAF processes has been developed using a Simulated
  Test Vehicle (STV). The STV\, can be easily built under controlled condit
 ion in the laboratory using different glass fibres and resin power to inve
 stigating effect of different variables on CAF separately. The advantage o
 f STV will be described and examples of material studies that can be under
 taken presented. </p>\n<p>Topics Covered: </p>\n<p>What is CAF<br />\nHow 
 does failure occur?<br />\nTesting techniques<br />\nTesting performance<b
 r />\nFailure modes<br />\nDesign and its impact on CAF<br />\nLatest rese

 6</p>\n<p>$200</p>\n<p>HALT training and application has focused primarily
  on electronic products. But\, HALT is a methodology\, and the basics can 
 be applied to any product and stress. The basic approach to HALT is to app
 ly a single stress in a stepwise manner until an operational limit or dest
 ruct limit is reached to find the strength margin of the product relative 
 to that stress. Similarly\, other stresses identified can be applied one a
 t a time to find limits. Once the limits are found\, an accelerated profil
 e can be determined and the product is then cycled to reveal weaknesses in
  the design that can be corrected. For electronics\, temperature\, repetit
 ive shock vibration\, and power variation or on/off cycling are typical st
 resses applied in HALT.</p>\n<p>To apply the HALT methodology to non-elect
 ronic products\, we need to begin with an understanding of the stresses ap
 plied to the product and the potential failure mechanisms precipitated. An
 alysis of the design and application with tools like Failure Modes and Eff
 ects Analysis\, Finite Element Analysis\, or similar approaches help ident
 ify the stresses to use in testing the product\, component\, or assembly. 
 A basic Physics of Failure approach is needed. Both overstress and cumulat
 ive damage wear out mechanisms will be discussed.<br />\nThis webinar will
  look at applying this approach to some electrical and mechanical products
  to illustrate how the HALT method can help improve the design and reliabi
 lity of products other than electronics. Although less work has been done 
 to use HALT in these products\, there is considerable benefit to applying 
 the HALT methodology.</p>\n<p>Presented by John Paschkewitz</p>

 res provide a unique perspective on design for manufacturability and relia
 bility. This course will provide valuable lessons learned from practical e
 xperience through discussion of material selection\, current electronics r
 esearch and failure analysis case studies. Analytical techniques for mater
 ials characterization will be discussed and how they can be used to determ
 ine root cause. Participants are encouraged to bring specific questions or
  examples of surface mount process difficulties to be shared in open discu
 ssion at the end of the course. </p>\n<p>Topics Covered:<br />\nAnalytical
  testing techniques<br />\nRoot causes of production failures<br />\nFailu
 re analysis studies — analytical techn iques used for determining root cau
 se for defects in fine-pitch printing\, PoP\, and high Tg laminate failure
