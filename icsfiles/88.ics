DESCRIPTION:<p>Material: same as October/November months</p>\n<p>Format: Ro
 und Robin followed by Double Elimination</p>\n<p>Who: Beginner and Teen</p
 >\n<p><a href='/download/8751/'>Download registration form</a></p>\n<p>Thi
 s tournament is a wonderful way for us to introduce Beginner/Bible Bowl to
  more churches and hopefully recruit additional teams to compete on a regu
 lar basis. We anticipate reaching out to teams all across the country who 
 would like a review earlier in the Bible Bowl season. We truly believe the
 re is no better way to get our young people in the word than through the m
 inistry of Bible Bowl. Our prayer is that the Bible Bowl ministry will get
  exposure through ECC/ICOM and that many more young people can delve into 
 God’s word on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>We will have a round robin and doub
 le elimination format for both Beginner and Bible Bowl. Depending on the n
 umber of teams\, we will either divide all of the teams into brackets and 
 do mini Round Robins that will determine seeding for the Double Eliminatio
 n tournament\, or all of the teams will play in a Round Robin and then pro
 ceed on to a Double Elimination tournament. Your prompt registration will 
 assist us in planning.</p>\n<p>Team registration will be <strong>$30 per t
 eam</strong>. Individual registration will be <strong>$15 per person</stro
 ng>. Please return the <strong>registration form by October 9\, 2015</stro
 ng>. The individual registration fee will also register your students for 
 the convention itself and allow them to participate in the Children and Te
 en Sessions. Information on the convention sessions is available online at
  icomvirginia.com to help you in promoting the event.</p>\n<p>Lodging info
 rmation can also be accessed through the ICOM website. Of course there are
  many other hotels in the area. If you need additional assistance with hou
 sing\, please let me know. We have not put together a list of hotels in th
 e area\, but would be happy to assist you\, if needed. There are also many
  fast food restaurants in easy access of the convention center for inexpen
 sive meals.</p>\n<p>Team registration will begin at the Greater Richmond C
 onvention Center Friday afternoon. Times and rooms will be sent as I know 
 more information. The Round Robin Competition will begin Friday afternoon 
 and the Double Elimination Tournament will begin on Saturday morning with 
 finals being held in the afternoon. Schedules will be sent out as we know 
 the number of teams participating.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to a great time
  of fellowship\, worship\, competition\, and spiritual renewal. Please do 
 not hesitate to call if we can be of assistance in any way.</p>
