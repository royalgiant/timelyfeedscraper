 and local gun store dealer Harry Mann\, looking for ways to expand his bus
 iness\, put a small gun show together at the Stardust Hotel. Fifty three y
 ears later\, that simple idea has developed into the world’s great Arms an
 d Armor collector’s event.</p>\n<p>Under the stewardship of renowned colle
 ctor\, dealer and publisher\, Wallace Beinfeld\, the Las Vegas Antique\, S
 porting Arms and Custom Knife maker’s Show brings together hundreds of dea
 lers\, makers and collectors. Where else can one find the knowledgeable de
 alers\, thousands of fine and historical firearms and handmade quality kni
 ves in the quantity and price range as can be found at the Las Vegas Show?

 interested legislators\, members of many Governmental agencies\, Hollywood
  personalities\, collector organizations and dealers from around the world
 .</p>\n<p>Recently acknowledged as the <strong>“Longest continuing running
  event in Las Vegas\,”</strong> 53 years\, plans exist for several years i
 nto the future at the Riviera Hotel’s 95\,000 square feet convention cente
 r.</p>\n<p>And\, while the Mid Winter Show is one of a very few large scal
 e\, quality events\, the Las Vegas <strong><a href='http://www.antiquearms

  Spring and Fall\, smaller in size\, maintain the same level of quality me

 1969\, the Sahara’s management asked Wally Beinfeld to take over the Show 
 Producer’s role. Beinfeld had shown award winning displays for several yea
 rs\, had helped to found collector’s organizations and was actively involv
 ed in developing new markets for firearms.</p>\n<p>As a member of Colt Fir
 earm’s product development committee\, Beinfeld had the opportunity to mee
 t and work with many key marketers. Contacts that would help increase the 
 size\, scope and impact of the Las Vegas Shows.</p>\n<p><a href='http://ww

 ve Gun Shows a year\, personally working with collector organizations to e
 xpand their reach into the market\, under Beinfeld’s stewardship\, the Las
  Vegas Show began to grow in size\, scope and prestige. In 1969\, the Show
  was held in a four thousand square foot room. About 50 exhibitors and col
 lectors set up and one hundred members of the public came to see Herb Glas
 s\, Arnold Chernoff\, Jim Serven\, John Malloy\, Norm Flayderman\, Bob Che
 rry and many of the other “Giants” of the industry.</p>\n<p>Today\, more t
 han six hundred exhibitors offering or just showing fine merchandise\, a d
 ozen collector organizations\, manufacturers of quality sporting arms\, mo
 re than a hundred custom handmade knife-makers and several thousand intere
 sted collectors join together at the Winter Show. You can still meet some 
 of the “Giants” as well as more contemporary great dealers\, Mitch Luksich
 \, Greg Martin\, John Gangel\, Mike Clark and dozens more.</p>\n<p>Happily
 \, the participation of “Giants” of the industry at the Show has parallele

 >\n<p>It is with great sorrow I need to inform you of the passing of an ic
 on in the gun world. Wallace Beinfeld passed away peacefully at the age of
  84. His battle with Alzheimer’s for the past two years ended Friday\, May
  10\, 2013.</p>\n<p>Wally produced the Las Vegas <strong><a href='http://w
 ww.antiquearmsshow.com/index.php' target='_blank'>Antique Arms Show</a></s
 trong> for 51 years. Many of you have been with him for most of the journe
 y. You have seen the show grow in size and merchandise\, from antique and 
 collectibles to sporting arms and custom knives. You were there in the ear
 ly days of the Sahara\, to the great tent show\, the Riviera\, Mandalay Ba
 y\, and back to the Riviera. While there were other short term stops\, Wal
 ly was always thinking of ways to better position the show for his exhibit
 ors. Wally appreciated your support in building the highest quality histor
 ical firearms show in the country.</p>\n<p>Paul and I have assumed the res
 ponsibility of the daily operations and management of the show. Working wi
 th Wally for the past fifteen years\, we are honored to continue his legac
 y. This was Wally’s passion! We will miss his guidance\, but always cheris
 h the opportunity he has provided.</p>\n<p>Paul and I want all of you to k
 now that we are available for you.</p>\n<p>Paul’s cell: 951-970-9669<br />

 shion the show will go on. We are planning on having the best show ever in
  January. In addition my partners and I have all the faith in Karen and Pa
 ul to continue Wally’s legacy. They have the company’s full support and we
  look forward to the next 50 years.”</p>\n<p>We will miss Wally so very mu

  legacy of the finest gun shows will live on in his honor.</p>\n<p>Sincere
