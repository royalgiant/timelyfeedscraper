DESCRIPTION:<p><a href='http://artprize.org'>ArtPrize</a> – Now is your cha
 nce to see Kevin’s three component art project titled “The Field Of Poetry
 ”.  This includes the 44 yellow yard signs\, mimicking a field of daffodil
 s with his  original poetry on them\, that gives the project its name.  It
  also includes the ‘root’ of “The Field of Poetry” titled “The Soul Travel
 er” which is Kevin’s moving 30 minute presentation reciting his various po
 etry while detailing the four themes of his work:  Love\, Fear\, Forgivene
 ss\, and Being in the world not of the world.  And the third component are
  the ‘seeds’ of “The Field of Poetry” compiled in the two volume set title
 d “The Wandering Crane”.  Don’t miss your chance to see all three componen
 ts together with the author reading from his own work.  Not to be missed!<
