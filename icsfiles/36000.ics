DESCRIPTION:<p>Lessons and Carols</p>\n<p>A traditional service of lessons 
 and carols\, in its basic structure was framed by Edward White Benson\, wh
 o later became Archbishop of Canterbury\, for Christmas Eve 1880 in Truro\
 , Cornwall\, England. Embraced by generations of Christians\, this service
  is popular both for its format and its flexibility. The original nine scr
 ipture readings can be combined or shortened in a variety of ways to best 
 serve Advent/Christmas celebrations. The carols can be changed from year t
 o year\, and they invite congregation participation.</p>\n<p>The NDS Schol
 a Cantorum will lead the NDS community on Sunday\, December 6\, 2015 at 5:
 00 pm in the Creche. The music featured will include sacred Advent and Chr
 istmas selections. Beloved scriptural readings will be tightly interwoven 
 with the sacred Advent and Christmas music. A continuous flow of scriptura
 l readings in alternation with sacred seasonal music will be performed sea
 mlessly\, with full and active musical participation by the congregation.<
