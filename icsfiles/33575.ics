 lection of contemporary art from the AIB collection.</p>\n<p style='text-a
 lign: center'>This year The Festival Gallery will host a selection of work
 s from the recent The Art of a Nation exhibition held at the Mall Gallerie
 s in London.</p>\n<p style='text-align: center'>Clifden Arts Festival is p
 roud to stage a selection from the renowned Allied Irish Banks Collection.
  Astutely collected since the 1980s\, the collection is regarded as one of
  the most important representations of Modern Irish Art. Certainly the ran
 ge\, quality and energy of the works displayed help to define Irish art an
 d Irish artists. A series of phases associated with Irish art are portraye
 d in this exhibition. The awareness of locality in Letitia Hamilton’s work
  to dealing with conflict and bereavement in the works of Willie Doherty a
 nd Shane Blount (image right) to the sensitivity and gentleness of Hughie 
 O’Donoghue’s and John Shinnors paintings and the originality and ferocious
  talent that is Dorothy Cross.</p>\n<p style='text-align: center'>Seamus H
 eaney\, in his introduction to Modern Art in Ireland (1997)\, compares the
  development of Irish art to the flowing of a river. The course of Irish a
 rt has gradually gathered width and depth\, confidently widening to incorp
 orate Modernist mainstream and then merging seamlessly with contemporary i
 nternational art. Significantly\, the flow of Irish art continues to refle
 ct the epic and profound journey of discovery of the Irish people in findi
 ng a clear cultural identity.</p>\n<p style='text-align: center'>The perce
 ptive awareness\, sensitivity to locality\, culture and political sources 
 can also be viewed at the exhibition\, also from this collection\, on disp
 lay at the AIB branch on the Galway Road\, Clifden.</p>\n<p style='text-al
 ign: center'>The exhibitions are a collaboration between Clifden Arts Fest
 ival and Allied Irish Banks.</p>\n<p style='text-align: center'>The Festiv
 al wishes to express its gratitude to Allied Irish Banks and in particular
  to Maureen Porteous for her advice\, encouragement and support in bringin
 g this selection to Clifden Arts Festival.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>This annual festival is emerging as the perfect way to wrap 
 up the end of summer and embrace the winter. The Inishbofin Set dancing an
 d Trad Weekend has proven to be an impressive occasion resulting in Inishb
 ofin overflowing with talent in the shape of dancers\, musicians and artis
 ts alike. Building on the exceptional success of the last five years\, the
  sixth annual Inishbofin Island Set Dancing & Trad Weekend will no doubt b
 e another successful year!</p>\n<p>The Inishbofin Set dancing and Trad Wee
 kend will give dancers who used to set dance years ago\, as well as the yo
 unger generation of learners\, the knowledge of set dancing and the confid
 ence to get up and put what they learn to practice. The weekend will also 
 highlight how set dancing plays a distinctive role in reviving the ongoing
  vibrancy of the artistic life on Inishbofin – which includes the invaluab
 le contribution of the older generation of islanders in passing on the ‘In
 ishbofin Half Set.’</p>\n<p>The weekend will run from Friday to Sunday eve
 ning and will see a wealth of entertainment through song and dance.</p>

 fiddle and guitar music\, Zoë Conway and John McIntyre bring to the stage 
 sympathetic arrangements of traditional Irish music\, compositions and son
 gs\, old and new.</p>\n<p>The husband and wife folk duo possesses a rare f
 acility to draw pieces into their repertoire from other genres such as cla
 ssical\, jazz and world music and express this material in way which not o
 nly displays the sheer range and knowledge of both instrumentalists but al
 so exhibits the wonderful versatility of their instruments.</p>\n<p>The re
 cent release of their critically acclaimed album entitled Go Mairir I Bhfa
 d_Long Life To You has brought international attention to the duo\, and so
  they are increasingly in demand in Ireland and abroad.</p>\n<p>For this u
 nique album\, twelve leading Irish composers were commissioned to each cre
 ate a piece specifically for Zoë and John\, for fiddle and guitar. Liz Car
 roll\, Máirtín O’Connor\, Steve Cooney\, Frankie Gavin\, Andy Irvine\, Cha
 rlie Lennon\, Donal Lunny\, Tommy Peoples\, Peadar Ó Riada\, Mícheál Ó Súi

 d by Mikel Murfi</p>\n<p>“I think none of us is old\, me heart has never b

  dead\, autumn is closing in and cobbler Pat Farnon has “some business” to
  do in town.</p>\n<p>“Today is beginning to feel very special and I’ve no 
 idea why.”</p>\n<p>The Man In The Woman’s Shoes follows Pat as he walks th
 e five miles from his white cottage to town and back again. He meets unfor
 gettable characters along the way\, including water diviner Huby Patterson
 \, GAA enthusiast extraordinaire Kitsy Rainey\, big voiced Casimir Marshal
 l\, an array of farmers all named Gilmartin and Kemp\, a man whose idea of
  a good time is to direct traffic wherever he may find it. Pat may be an a

 ously funny\, tender and at times downright daft play that will leave you 
 uplifted and in love with life again.</p>\n<p>The Man In The Woman’s Shoes
