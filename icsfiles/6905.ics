DESCRIPTION:<h3>THE ELDERS SALON SONOMA</h3>\n<h4>August 25th topic:</h4>\n
 <h4>LOOKING BACK—CONNECTIONS WITH ELDERS</h4>\n<blockquote><p>Did it happe
 n? What are our memories of the experiences? Many of us were born and grew
  up in a time when elders were pushed aside\, considered to be used up\, e
 ven regarded with scorn. Some of us were fortunate to have a rich experien
 ce of an elder or elders. How have our experiences resonated through our l
 ives?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Our first meeting on the topic–<strong>“WHAT IS
  AN ELDER?”</strong> was a great success with 22 enthusiastic people in at
 tendance\, ready to engage! Since then\, The Elder Salon is off to a great
  start. We look forward to seeing you\, and hearing your ideas.</p>\n<p><s
 trong>The Elders Salon Sonoma</strong> meets the 4th Tuesday of each month
 \, from 10 am to noon at El Verano Elementary School 18606 Riverside Dr\, 
 Sonoma in the Family Resource Center. The space is wheelchair accessible. 
 There will be no charge for the meetings. Much gratitude is due El Verano 
 School and the Family Resource Center for the opportunity to meet there.</
 p>\n<p>The purpose of the Elders Salon is to synthesize the experience\, e
 nergy and curiosity of people who have already entered or are just discove
 ring this developmental stage of their lives. An elder is self-defined\, a
 lthough age 55 and up is generally the lower age of participants. We are a
  nonhierarchial group\, recognizing that each individual is their own expe
 rt\, and will not be relying on “experts” from outside. Our topics will be
  set ahead of the meeting and introduced by the facilitators or the person
  who suggested the subject. Typically we will break into small groups for 
 part of the time to encourage personal discovery and more intimate exchang
 e\, giving everyone a chance to express themselves.   After that\, a retur
 n to the larger group\, to talk about our discoveries allows for the wisdo
 m of the whole to emerge. Diversity of expression will foster growth withi
 n both individuals and the group as a whole.</p>\n<figure id='attachment_2

 </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2015</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>June 23 – “What 
 is an Elder?”</li>\n<li>July 28  – “Regrets\, and Compassion”</li>\n<li>Au

 l>\n<p>Come join us.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>About the Facilitators</stron
 g></p>\n<p>In 2005\,<strong> Trymon (Spyder) Hunter</strong> became involv
 ed in the care of a long time friend who began to deteriorate physically a
 fter being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. Through that experience he m
 et David (Lucky) Goff\, who with Alexandra Hart\, co-founded the first Eld
 ers Salon in 2010. Always interested in personal development\, this concep
 t was ideal for Trymon.</p>\n<p><strong> Iris (Ruth) Lombard</strong> has 
 been excited by the willingness of the people that she has met at the Elde
 rs Salon to be themselves\, without apology. She has learned by their exam
 ple the depth this brings to an individual. The diversity of people and op
 inions brings constant richness to her life.</p>\n<p>Spyder and Iris live 
 in Boyes Hot Springs\, so it seemed natural to grow another Elder Salon in
  order to bring the potential wisdom of our local elders home to our commu
 nity.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorph
