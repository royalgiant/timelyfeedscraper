DESCRIPTION:<p>The focus is on “fun” as children and caregivers alike learn
  to use energy to heal our bodies and our minds. This day-long event combi
 nes the playful but effective teachings of Spring Forest Qigong Master Chu
 nyi Lin with the beautiful setting and camp-like atmosphere of Split Rock.
   Master Lin is the founder of Spring Forest Qigong\, and coauthor of the 
 #1 Amazon.com bestseller\, Born A Healer.  He has been named Qigong Master
  of the year by the International Qigong Committee and has introduced more
  than a quarter of a million people to the practice during the 20-year his
 tory of Spring Forest Qigong.  Through the power of energy healing\, child
 ren\, parents\, and caregivers will learn to feel the flow of energy in th
 e body and how to direct that flow\, within yourself and for others. Simpl
 e guided meditations will also introduce participants to the power of visu
 alization and self-healing. And a special emphasis on Qi-ssage and specifi
 c healing techniques will help all of us learn how to be our “own best doc
 tors.”  In addition to the Qigong learning sessions\, participants will ha
 ve free time to explore and enjoy camp activities at Split Rock. Splash in
  the swimming pool\, paddle a canoe or the Huck Finn raft around the 4-acr
 e pond\, fish for brim and largemouth bass\, or take the zip line over the
  pond (and drop in if you dare!). An 18-hole disc golf course offers a rel
 axing tour of the property’s landmarks\, and a trail system through the fo
 rested areas traverses an expanding woodland playground for young children

DESCRIPTION:<p>Biologist Kriti Sharma will offer a presentation on her new 
 book\, Interdependence: Biology and Beyond\, Sunday\, October 4\, 11:00am 
 at the Chapel Hill Zen Center</p>\n<p>The teaching that all phenomena are 
 interdependent is central to all Mahayana Buddhist traditions\, including 
 Soto Zen. What does interdependence — or dependent arising — really mean? 
 Do we experience ourselves as thoroughly interdependent with our world — a
 nd if not\, why not? What habitual\, everyday assumptions function as barr
 iers to realizing interdependence\, and what happens when we examine and p
 otentially dissolve those assumptions? Kriti Sharma will read from and dis
 cuss her new book\, Interdependence: Biology and Beyond (Fordham Universit
 y Press\, New York\, 2015)\, with a focus on how a clear and coherent phil
 osophical and scientific view of interdependence can be a support for joy 
 and awakeness in everyday life.</p>

 n her bestselling memoirs\, Ruth Reichl has long illuminated the theme of 
 how food defines us and she does it again with My Kitchen Year!\n \n  \n 
 \n In the fall of 2009\, the food world was rocked when Gourmet magazine w
 as abruptly shuttered by its parent company. No one was more stunned by th
 is unexpected turn of events than its beloved editor in chief\, Ruth Reich
 l\, who suddenly faced an uncertain professional future. As she struggled 
 to process what had seemed unthinkable\, Reichl turned to the one place th
 at had always provided sanctuary. “I did what I always do when I’m confuse
 d\, lonely\, or frightened\,” she writes. “I disappeared into the kitchen.
 ”\n \n  \n \n My Kitchen Year follows the change of seasons—and Reichl’s e
 motions—as she slowly heals through the simple pleasures of cooking. While
  working 24/7\, Reichl would “throw quick meals together” for her family a
 nd friends. Now she has the time to rediscover what cooking meant to her.
 \n \n  \n \n About Cooks & Books\n \n This series was founded with a premi
 se that there’s no better way to explore a new cookbook than by talking wi
 th the author\, and sampling and delving into those dishes with seriously 
 fun and delicious discussion. It is a collaboration between Fearrington’s 
 Executive Chef Colin Bedford and Keebe Fitch of McIntyre’s Books\, one of 
 the South’s most celebrated independent bookstores\, with an amazing cookb
 ook selection. Learn more about the series at http://www.fearrington.com/v
