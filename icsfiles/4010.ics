DESCRIPTION:<p>As announced at the County Log Chew Wendy and her team have 
 been busy working out the details for this years trip to Paultons Park on 
 November 7th and there will be some changes to arrangements this year.</p>
 \n<p>The annual visit to Paultons Park has been getting more and more popu
 lar to the point where the numbers have got too high for everyone to have 
 the great day that we and Paultons Park want them to have. For this reason
  Paultons Park 2015 will be a trip for colonies only rather than families.
  You can still have parent helpers to help you with ratios and leaders can
  still bring their own children.</p>\n<p>The day will be available for the
  price of £16 per Beaver / Leader (before you add any cost for coach etc…)
  and booking forms will be available soon\, details to be posted here when
  available.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of the attractions will be open subj
 ect to weather including the new Critter Creek. (Closed rides are Seal Fal
 ls\, Digger Ride\, Go-Karts\, Flying Frog and Miss Rabbit’s Helicopter Rid
 e). In an exciting change for this year 16 year olds will be counted as re
 sponsible adults for the purpose of on ride accompaniment. This means your
  older Young Leaders can now count as adults for going on rides (but not f
 or Scouting ratios). There will also be extra Young Leaders around the rid
 es where you may need extra adults.</p>
