 any screening of geeky films and TV shows.</p>\n<p>On October 3rd\, 2015\,
  we’re celebrating a year that’s made us stronger\, tastier\, more fun\, a
 nd geekier – all because of YOU. We’ll be celebrating and thanking you all

 com/chicagogames/events/224222392/'>joining the Meetup event</a>!</p>\n<p>
 <b>Who can come to this event?</b></p>\n<p>Anyone over the age of 21.</p>
 \n<p><b>Can I come to this event if I’m not single?</b></p>\n<p>We aren’t 
 checking relationship statuses at the door\, but you will probably feel fa
 r more comfortable coming to one of the many other great Chicago Game Love
 rs events that are for anyone and everyone (of which there are about 50 ev
 ery month all around the Chicagoland area!). Check out the Chicago Game Lo
 vers calendar page (<a class='linkified' href='http://www.meetup.com/chica
 gogames/events/'>http://www.meetup.com/chicagogames/events/</a>) to find a
  great event that will probably be more up your alley!</p>\n<p>Or keep you
 r eyes peeled for our next <a href='https://geekbarchicago.com/event/poly-
 meet-geek'>Poly Meet & Geek</a>!</p>\n<p><b>Is this speed dating?</b></p>
 \n<p>Nope. We’ll have board games like Settlers of Catan\, Battlestar Gala
 ctica\, and King of Tokyo\, some video games like Super Smash Bros. Melee 
 and Pokemon Stadium\, some art supplies and coloring books so you’ll have 
 something to talk about and do with your hands.</p>\n<p>We’ll also have li
 ttle cards you can fill out with your contact information\, like so: “<i>H
 i\, my name is ___________. I really liked _________________(playing a gam
 e/geeking out/coloring) with you and I’d love to hang out again sometime. 
 If we did get together\, I would like it to be a (check one) _______ DATE-
 date/_______ FRIEND-date. If you’d like to get in touch you can reach me a
 t _____________@________________________.</i>”</p>\n<p>If you like someone
 \, you can fill out a card and awkwardly hand it to them before you (or th
 ey) leave. They may email you. They may not – there is absolutely no oblig
 ation! The idea is to make a low-key and friendly event where everyone can
  meet some new people without any pressure or “hitting on” (please see <a 
 href='https://geekbarchicago.com/about-2/anti-harrassment-policy/'>Geek Ba
 r’s Anti-Harassment Policy</a>) needing to take place.</p>\n<p><b>Is this 
 for straight people only?</b></p>\n<p>Nope! However\, if you feel more com
 fortable in an atmosphere designed specifically for the LGBTQ community\, 
 keep an eye out for our next <a href='https://geekbarchicago.com/event/rai
 nbow-meet-geek'>Rainbow Meet & Geek</a>!</p>\n<p><b>What if no one of my p
 referred gender or orientation shows up?</b></p>\n<p>SOME nice people of s
 ome sort will show up\, and you’ll play games with them\, and it will be a
  pretty fun night out of your house.</p>\n<p><b>What else should we know?<
 /b></p>\n<p>There’s a full bar and a menu of awesome food you can order.</
 p>\n<p><b>I’m scared it will be awkward.</b></p>\n<p>We are (wo)men of act
 ion\, and lies do not become us: It will probably be awkward\, for the fir
 st 5-10 minutes. Putting yourself out there as ‘I am single and actively l
 ooking’ is awkward and vulnerable. It’s also an incredibly brave and wonde
 rful thing to do. If you come to this thing\, you may not meet the R2 to y
 our Threepio\, but you won’t be alone.</p>

 a href='http://www.windycon.org/'>Windycon</a> is sponsoring a Fluxx tourn
 ament at Geek Bar Beta. Fluxx is a card game\, played with a specially des
 igned deck published by Looney Labs\, Windycon’s gaming Guests of Honor th
 is year. It is different from most other card games in that the rules and 
 the conditions for winning are altered throughout the game\, via cards pla
 yed by the players. Because the rules and goals change\, people who have n
 ever played the game have a good chance of winning\, “beginner’s luck” tru
 ly comes into play.</p>\n<p>The tournament will run from 1PM until it ends
 . There will be 1st\, 2nd\, and 3rd place prizes. Each game you play will 
 be with a randomly picked version of Fluxx\, so who knows what you’ll be p
 laying next. (One game might be basic Fluxx\, then Zombie Fluxx\, Pirate F
 luxx\, Cthulhu Fluxx\, or even Monty Python Fluxx.) Anyone can enter and a
 nyone can win. You can win a membership to Windycon\, t-shirts\, decals\, 
 and more! Come in\, bring your friends\, join us\, and have fun. To regist
 er please contact hotel@windycon.org. You can also show up at Geek Bar Bet
 a the day of the event and register that day.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t famili
 ar with the game\, we will give lessons at the tournament as necessary\, o

 </a></p>\n<p>We’re welcoming DePaul University’s Dr. Paul Booth – associat
 e professor of Media and Cinema Studies in the College of Communication – 
 to bring his academic focus to the popularity of board games. Here’s how h
 e descibes his talk:</p>\n<p>“Board games are more popular than ever\; ove
 r the last 10 years board game sales have been rising 10 to 20 percent <em
 >per year</em>. But in an increasingly-complex mediated world\, and as the
  digital has become the buzzword of the decade\, how to make sense of this
  meteoric increase in popularity of such low-tech entertainment? In my res
 earch\, I’ve explored the relationship between media products and the boar
 d games that are based on them (“paratextual board games”)\, and in this t
 alk\, I’ll look at some of the ways that these paratextual board games sli
 p into our contemporary media environment.”</p>\n<p><a href='http://www.mc

 <p>Anyone in the LGBTQ community over the age of 21.</p>\n<p><b>Can I come

  coming to one of the many other great Chicago Game Lovers events that are
  for anyone and everyone (of which there are about 50 every month all arou

  (<a class='linkified' href='http://www.meetup.com/chicagogames/events/'>h

 ers of Catan\, Battlestar Galactica\, and King of Tokyo\, some video games
  like Super Smash Bros. Melee and Pokemon Stadium\, some art supplies and 
 coloring books so you’ll have something to talk about and do with your han
 ds.</p>\n<p>We’ll also have little cards you can fill out with your contac

 ________________(playing a game/geeking out/coloring) with you and I’d lov

 be a (check one) _______ DATE-date/_______ FRIEND-date. If you’d like to g

 >”</p>\n<p>If you like someone\, you can fill out a card and awkwardly han
 d it to them before you (or they) leave. They may email you. They may not 
 – there is absolutely no obligation! The idea is to make a low-key and fri

 l be a pretty fun night out of your house.</p>\n<p><b>What else should we 
 know?</b></p>\n<p>There’s a full bar and a menu of awesome food you can or
 der.</p>\n<p><b>I’m scared it will be awkward.</b></p>\n<p>We are people o
 f action\, and lies do not become us: It will probably be awkward\, for th
 e first 5-10 minutes. Putting yourself out there as ‘I am single and activ

 wonderful thing to do. If you come to this thing\, you may not meet the R2

 through the asteroid field of love\, dating\, and Harrison Ford movies. A 
 long time ago\, in a galaxy far\, far away . . . <a href='http://www.eilee
 ntull.com'>Eileen Tull</a> fell in love with Han Solo. And then with a pro
 fessor by day\, loud-punching adventurer by night Indiana Jones. And then 
 with the man behind the hat\, the whip\, and the tight space pants: Harris
 on Ford himself. But once the movie is over and the credits roll\, how are
  you supposed to navigate romantic relationships in the real world? Nothin
 g can stop Eileen from trying to find the scruffy-looking Nerf herder she’
 s looking for.</p>\n<p>There is a $10 suggested donation. You will have th

  United Nations has recognized 2015 as the International Year of Soils\, y
 et how many of us appreciate the fact that we can’t eat\, breathe\, drink\
 , or maintain healthy communities without good soil. Let’s talk dirty and 
 explore the diverse and complex world of soil as well as how local scienti
 sts manage soil systems to maintain ecosystem services. Come learn how Chi
 cago scientists are incorporating soil organisms into green roofs to manag
 e storm water\, cool neighborhoods\, and reduce energy costs. Also\, learn
  what you can do to improve soil health in your own backyard and beyond.</

 ce just after World War II\, US and global researchers have attempted to e
 volve diamond’s use beyond simple gem. With extreme material properties su
 ch as ultra harness\, complete transparency to visible light\, ultrahigh t
 hermal conductivity\, ultrafast power & frequency handling/switching\, in 
 addition to many others–diamond it would seem\, has been historically earm
 arked for technological use. Over 60 years later from the first successes 
 in the lab synthesis of diamond\, the capability to “grow” diamond has exp
 anded dramatically ranging from growing the perfect diamond gem to ultrath
 in nanodiamond. With modern electronics performance and design demands eve
 r-increasing\, what role does diamond have to play alongside such advanced
  materials as Sapphire and Graphene? How does diamond stand to impact end 
 use applications such as wearable electronics\, broadband communication\, 
 and electric vehicles? How far are we from a “Diamond Age of Microelectron
 ics”?</p>\n<p>Adam Khan is Founder & currently Chief Executive of AKHAN Se
 miconductor. Previous to AKHAN Semiconductor\, Mr. Khan studied both physi
 cs and electrical engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago bef
 ore pursuing research at the graduate level at Stanford University’s Stanf
 ord Nanofabrication Facility (SNF). Mr. Khan has worked in various positio
 ns within the field of condensed matter research ranging from theoretical 
 work in unconventional superconductor systems to applied work in diamond s
 emiconductor systems. Mr. Khan’s professional research associations includ
 e membership with the Materials Research Society (MRS)\, American Physical
  Society (APS)\, as well as research affiliations with the Stanford Nanofa
 brication Facility and the Center for Nanoscale Materials at Argonne Natio
 nal Laboratory. Mr. Khan has authored several patents\, technical publicat
 ions\, and invited technical talks\, in addition to co-chairing the 2014 N
 ew Diamond and Nano Carbons conference (Materials Research Society). Among
 st his award winning research\, Mr. Khan is co-inventor of the Miraj Diamo
 nd™ Platform\, the world’s first CMOS Compatible N-type Diamond Materials 
 & Devices—named by R&D magazine to the 2013 R&D 100. Amongst his achieveme
 nts in business\, Mr. Khan recently led AKHAN to win the 2013 Midwest Inno
 vation Summit (MW CleanTech Open). As a frequent speaker at academic\, bus
 iness\, & industry events on diamond materials\, Semiconductor technology\
 , Cleantech\, & Energy Efficient Technologies. He has been featured in num

 ____.</i>”</p>\n<p>If you like someone\, you can fill out a card and awkwa
 rdly hand it to them before you (or they) leave. They may email you. They 
 may not – there is absolutely no obligation! The idea is to make a low-key
  and friendly event where everyone can meet some new people without any pr
 essure or “hitting on” (please see <a href='https://geekbarchicago.com/abo

 , and you’ll play games with them\, and it will be a pretty fun night out 
 of your house.</p>\n<p><b>What else should we know?</b></p>\n<p>There’s a 
 full bar and a menu of awesome food you can order.</p>\n<p><b>I’m scared i
 t will be awkward.</b></p>\n<p>We are people of action\, and lies do not b
 ecome us: It will probably be awkward\, for the first 5-10 minutes. Puttin
 g yourself out there as ‘I am single and actively looking’ is awkward and 
 vulnerable. It’s also an incredibly brave and wonderful thing to do. If yo
 u come to this thing\, you may not meet the R2 to your Threepio\, but you 
 won’t be alone.</p>

  Museum of Science and Industry (MSI) recently opened a one-of-its-kind te
 mporary exhibit\, Robot Revolution. This unprecedented exhibit features mo
 re than 40 robots from all over the world. MSI’s robot wrangling team spen
 t five years developing this program with the help of esteemed robotics ad
 visors. The team scoured the world — including Japan\, China\, Germany\, a
 nd France — to find the most advanced and exciting robots to showcase to t
 he public. Kathleen McCarthy was part of this team.</p>\n<p>McCarthy and t
 he team realized that having more than 40 robots in one exhibit\, many of 
 which had never been showcased in a museum environment\, would require ext
 ra handling. The team hired three robot specialists to work exclusively in
  the Robot Revolution space. Anna Brill\, a 21-year-old college student fr
 om Massachusetts\, is one of those specialists. Brill and the team can be 
 seen working in the exhibit\, from making 250 battery changes a day to tin
 kering with the robots in the public-facing “robot garage” — a windowed sp
 ace where guests can see the specialists at work.</p>\n<p><strong>Anna Bri
 ll</strong> is one of the three robot specialists working at the Robot Rev
 olution exhibit. She handles all of the day-to-day tasks associated with t
 he exhibit — from keeping more than 40 robots running properly\, to troubl
 eshooting issues\, to chatting with curious young museum guests. She is cu
 rrently taking a gap year from her studies at the University of Pennsylvan
 ia where she is pursuing her bachelor and master’s degrees in mechanical e
 ngineering. Her fascination with robots began when she joined a FIRST Robi
 tcs Competition team in high school and continued with the robotics resear
 ch she was involved in while at Penn. Through her research at the Kod*lab\
 , a subsidiary of the Penn Engineering GRASP Lab\, she has studied the beh
 avior of six-legged robots on low-friction surfaces. She recently publishe
 d a paper on her work with a leaping\, tailed\, bipedal robot\, which land
 ed her the honor of presenting at a robitcs conference in Hamburg\, German
 y this fall.</p>\n<p><strong>Kathleen McCarthy</strong> is the director of
  collections and head curator at the Museum of Science and Industry. McCar
 thy is responsible for the care of MSI’s 35\,000 artifacts and those on lo
 an for display\, as well as the research and development of content for ex
 hibits. Since joining MSI in 2000\, McCarthy has overseen the development 
 and installation of multiple exhibits and added high-profile artifacts to 
 the collection. During the development of Robot Revolution\, McCarthy spen
 t several weeks in Japan visiting the top robotics companies. A key to the
  success of Robot Revolution are the relationships and knowledge she has b
 uilt\, and throughout the four-year run of the traveling exhibition\, McCa
 rthey will ensure the robots are updated to showcase the latest breakthrou
 ghs in robotis technologies. Prior to joining MSI\, McCarthy was the regis
 trar for the Haifa Faisal Collection of Saudi Arabian Artifacts. She has a
 lso worked for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago\, Krannert Art Mu
 seum\, and taught glassblowing at the Toledo Museum of Art. McCarthy earne
 d her MFA in Sculpture from the University of Illinois\, during which she 
 studied art history in Cairo. The recipient of a fellowship award from the
  Illinois Arts Council\, her sculptures have been exhibited across the U.S
 . and Japan.</p>

  Rupununi region of Guyana is a mix of lowland savannas and tropical fores
 ts. The vast savannas include an expansive network of wetlands that connec
 t the Guyana’s main river drainage\, Essequibo River\, to the Amazon River
  during the rainy season. This unique biogeographic feature influences fis
 h communities of the area. One of the fish species found here is in dire n
 eed of protection. Arapaima\, threatened throughout their range\, are the 
 world’s largest scaled fish\, weighing as much as 400lbs\, and belonging t
 o one of the most ancient lineages of freshwater fish\; their ancestors sh
 ared the vast wetlands of prehistoric South America with the dinosaurs. Th
 ey are also a historically important resource for Guyana’s indigenous comm
 unities. In addition to revealing the basic life history of these famous b
 ut poorly-understood animals through surveys and radio tracking\, Lesley’s
  research is also aimed at helping the people of the North Rupununi region
  establish a protected area on their traditional lands\, which face biolog
 ical and cultural threats from large-scale agriculture\, mining\, and ille
 gal logging.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Lesley de Souza</strong>‘s fascination wi
 th the natural world began at an early age. Growing up in Alabama and Braz
 il gave her a deep appreciation for the wildlife and cultures of North and
  South America\, and ultimately led her to a career as a conservation biol
 ogist. Her Undergraduate and doctoral studies at Auburn University focused
  on the molecular ecology of Neotropical fish and allowed her to describe 
 several new species to science\, but she was most profoundly affected by w
 orking closely in the field with the indigenous people of South America\, 
 including the Wapishana and Macushi communities of southern Guyana. These 
 experiences led her to focus her research on projects with potential benef
 its for both fragile ecosystems and threatened human cultures. It is her m
 ission to contribute to the preservation of wildlife and human lifelihoods
  and\, more broadly\, to inspire humans to rethink our place in the natura
 l world.</p>
