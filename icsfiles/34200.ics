DESCRIPTION:<p>Hi Pack918<br />\nOur first camp out of the school year find
 s us at the Irvine Regional Outdoor Education Center! Accessed via Irvine 
 Regional Park in Orange CA – at the end of Jamboree near the 241. This 210
 -acre facility is owned and operated by the BSA Orange County Council. In 
 addition to the campfires\, s’mores and Skits the schedule includes:<br />
 \n* Zip Line<br />\n* BB Guns<br />\n* Swimming/Waterslide<br />\nNote the
  event limitations below. All participants for the first two events MUST H
 AVE (1) Shooting Sports\, (2) Cope & Zip Line Waivers signed and with them
  to participate (they will be emailed to you separately or you can downloa
 d from the IROEC website at www.outdooreducationcenter.org/forms .</p>\n<p
 >If your child does not have the waiver signed and available\, they will N
 OT be allowed to participate in those activities. Additionally\, you’ll ne
 ed a current BSA Health & Fitness form on file.</p>\n<p>Fees are:<br />\n$
 20 per person<br />\nNo special pricing for saturday attendees.<br />\nThe
  fee includes all meals on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday.  (Friday even
 ing meal you are on your own\, though we will have a cracker barrel of hea
 lthy snacks)</p>\n<p>Note that the Zip Line & BB Gun are ONLY available to
  the first 60 kids PAID signups! Adults will be able to swim but Zip Line 
 and BB Guns are for the kids (unless spaces are available). To ensure your
  son/sibling gets access – PLEASE plan on paying at the Pack Meeting on Mo
 nday\, September 7th with a A PERSONAL CHECK made out to Cub Scouts of Pac
 k#918.</p>\n<p>You’ll need to sign your child(ren) up for each of the even
 ts so that I can keep a headcount of each – so you may have to go into the
  sign up sheet a couple of times. (Sorry\, I couldn’t figure out how to ma
 ke the sign up headcount easier)</p>\n<p>DEADLINE TO SIGN UP IS THURSDAY\,
  OCTOBER 9TH so that we can provider IROEC an accurate headcount.</p>\n<p>
 FAQ:<br />\nWhat if my son does not meet the weight limits for the Zip lin
 e? Zip line riding is at the discretion of the IROEC Zip Line director who
  will ascertain whether it is safe for your son to ride the line. IF in hi
 s/her determination it is not safe\, we’ll have your son go through the BB
  Gun range twice\, once on Sat PM and once on Sun AM. (trust me…he’ll have
   a ball with the BB Guns!)</p>\n<p>The above only pertains to Cub Scouts 
 – if a sibling does not meet the weight requirements\, they can observe th
 e boys doing Cub Scout things…but cannot participate in the event. Again\,
  this is for the safety of the participants. </p>\n<p>Can I drop off my so
 n? Yes\, of course – provided he is not a Tiger (Tigers must be accompanie
 d by their parent) However\, keep in mind that Scouting is a family orient
 ed activity – we’d love to have you with us.</p>\n<p>Will my son earn any 
 Badges/Requirements/Achievement awards? He’ll earn the BB Gun Belt Loop at
  a minimum\, (provided he participates and does his best!). Awards for oth
 er activities are still being developed. There is no award for Zip-lining 
 and unless we put together a Swimming belt loop program – he’ll likely jus
 t be having fun in the pool at that time.</p>\n<p>Can a sibling attend? Ye
 s\, the whole family is welcome! But do note that the activities have cert
 ain restrictions:</p>\n<p>Zip Line – 8 years old or 60 pounds. Boys who ar
 e younger (Tigers & some Wolves) must be at least 50 pounds – and at the d
 iscretion of the director may be allowed to wear a weight belt designed to
  allow them to complete the ‘zip’. If the IROEC deems the Child unsafe to 
 ride the Zipline\, we’ll seek an alternative activity for him or refund yo
 u a portion of your fee. Children under 50 pounds are not allowed on the Z
 ip line.<br />\nBB Gun –  Consistent with Tiger Cub rules\, Kids 7 and und
 er must have an Adult (Parent) with them. For their safety\, Children less
  than 7 years old are not allowed on the firing range.<br />\nSwimming – “
 Any child potty trained (not in diapers) can participate\; however all kid
 s must pass a swim test to swim in the ‘deep end’”.  No arm floaties are a
 llowed\, but life jackets may be worn.</p>\n<p>For more information please
