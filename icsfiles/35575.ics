DESCRIPTION:<p>By celebrating World Philosophy Day each year\, on the third
  Thursday of November\, UNESCO underlines the enduring value of philosophy
  for the development of human thought\, for each culture and for each indi
 vidual. World Philosophy Day 2014 falls on 20 November. Events at UNESCO H
 eadquarters in Paris\, on 19 and 20 November 2014\, will contribute to the
  overarching question of “Social Transformations and Intercultural Dialogu
 e” with a round table discussion to launch the “Philosophy Manual\, A Sout
 h-South Perspective”\, developed with the support of the Abdullah bin Abdu
 laziz International Programme for a Culture of Peace and Dialogue.</p>\n<p
 >Additional events will take place at UNESCO Headquarters\, including in p
 articular a conference on “New Philosophical Practices” and a roundtable o
 n “The contribution of Ali ibn Abi Talib’s thought to a culture of peace a
 nd intercultural dialogue”. Events will also take place around the world t
 hroughout the month of November.</p>\n<p>In establishing World Philosophy 
 Day in 2005\, UNESCO’s General Conference highlighted the importance of th
 is discipline\, especially for young people\, underlining that “philosophy
  is a discipline that encourages critical and independent thought and is c
 apable of working towards a better understanding of the world and promotin
 g tolerance and peace”. UNESCO’s General Conference was convinced that “th
 e institutionalization of Philosophy Day at UNESCO as ‘World Philosophy Da
 y’ would win recognition for and give strong impetus to philosophy and\, i
 n particular\, to the teaching of philosophy in the world”.</p>\n<p>UNESCO
  leads World Philosophy Day – but does not own it. It belongs to everyone\
 , everywhere\, who cares about philosophy. If you would like to have your 
 WPD events mentioned on the UNESCO website\, simply send brief details of 
 them to: <a href='mailto:wpd@unesco.org' rel='nofollow'>wpd@unesco.org</a>
